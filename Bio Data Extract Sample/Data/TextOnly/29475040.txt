In the last years, several reports have established the notion that metabolism is not just a housekeeping process, but instead an active effector of physiological changes. The idea that the metabolic status may rule a wide range of phenomena in cell biology is starting to be broadly accepted. Thus, current developmental biology has begun to describe different ways by which the metabolic profile of the cell and developmental programs of the organism can crosstalk. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which metabolism impacts on processes governing development. We review the growing body of evidence that supports the notion that aerobic glycolysis is required in cells undergoing fast growth and high proliferation, similarly to the Warburg effect described in tumor cells. Glycolytic metabolism explains not only the higher ATP synthesis rate required for cell growth, but also the uncoupling between mitochondrial activity and bioenergetics needed to provide anabolism with sufficient precursors. We also discuss some recent studies, which show that in addition to its role in providing energy and carbon chains, the metabolic status of the cell can also influence epigenetic regulation of developmental processes. Although metabolic aspects of development are just starting to be explored, there is no doubt that ongoing research in this field will shape the future landscape of Developmental Biology.
