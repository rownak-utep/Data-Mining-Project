See the Update FAQ for more information. [2] This update is available from the Microsoft Download Center . [3] An update for the Conferencing Add-in for Microsoft Office Outlook is also available. For more information and download links, see Download the Conferencing Add-in for Microsoft Office Outlook . *The Updates Replaced column shows only the latest update in a chain of superseded updates. For a comprehensive list of updates replaced, go to the Microsoft Update Catalog , search for the update KB number, and then view update details (updates replaced information is on the Package Details tab). Update FAQ There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software? Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems. If multiple updates apply, they can be installed in any order. Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence? No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence. I am running Office 2010, which is listed as affected software. Why am I not being offered the update? The update is not applicable to Office 2010 on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows because the vulnerable code is not present. I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update? When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component. For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335 . For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update. Are there any prerequisites for any of the updates offered in this bulletin for affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business)? Yes. Customers running affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) must first install the 2965218 update for Office 2013 released in April, 2015, and then the 3039779 security update released in May, 2015. For more information about these two prerequisite updates, see: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2965218 Knowledge Base Article 3039779 Are there any related non-security updates that customers should install along with the Microsoft Live Meeting Console security update? Yes, in addition to releasing a security update for Microsoft Live Meeting Console, Microsoft has released the following non-security updates for the OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook. Where applicable, Microsoft recommends that customers install these updates to keep their systems up-to-date: OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (32-bit) (3115870) OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (64-bit) (3115870) See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3115870 for more information. Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center? Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the Microsoft Download Center only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario. Vulnerability Information Multiple Windows Graphics Component RCE Vulnerabilities Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities: In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities, and then convince users to open the document file. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts. In the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table for Microsoft Office, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for CVE-2016-3301 , CVE-2016-3303 , and CVE-2016-3304 . The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list: Vulnerability title CVE number Publicly disclosed Exploited Windows Graphics Component RCE Vulnerability CVE-2016-3301 No No Windows Graphics Component RCE Vulnerability CVE-2016-3303 No No Windows Graphics Component RCE Vulnerability CVE-2016-3304 No No Mitigating Factors Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for these vulnerabilities.
