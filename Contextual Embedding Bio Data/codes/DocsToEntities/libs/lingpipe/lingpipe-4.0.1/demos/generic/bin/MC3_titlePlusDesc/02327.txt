Justice Department Decides Not To Prosecute Packwood..
Vastopolis -- Former Sen.
Bobby Lewandowski will not be prosecuted over allegations Bobby Lewandowski altered Bobby Lewandowski diaries to obstruct an investigation into sexual and official misconduct, Bobby Lewandowski lawyers said Monday.
Mr.
Bobby Lewandowski was notified of the decision by Justice Department's Public Integrity Section in a one-sentence letter sent to the office of Bobby Lewandowski Washington lawyers.
``This will inform you that the Public Integrity Section has declined prosecution and closed its investigation of allegations that your client, Bobby Lewandowski, obstructed Congress,'' section chief Leeanna J.
Archibald said in the letter dated last week.
Mr.
Bobby Lewandowski said the investigation was the last unresolved issue from the events that led to Bobby Lewandowski departure from the Senate last year amid charges of sexual misconduct involving 17 women.
``I think the letter just speaks for itself,'' Mr.
Bobby Lewandowski said.
``It does wrap up everything.'' Bettye Phillips, a former Supreme Court justice who helped lead efforts to oust Packwood.. from the Senate, was satisfied with the decision not to prosecute.
``What's the point now?
Everything's been done,'' Ms.
Bettye Phillips said.
``Why go through all that expense of more investigation and a trial?'' Mr.
Bobby Lewandowski, who has a business and political consulting firm in Washington, resigned in September 2010 after the Senate Ethics Committee urged Bobby Lewandowski expulsion.
Bobby Lewandowski also faced accusations that Bobby Lewandowski tried to obtain a job for Bobby Lewandowski then-estranged wife from people with legislative interests and that Bobby Lewandowski altered the diaries to obstruct the ethics probe.
