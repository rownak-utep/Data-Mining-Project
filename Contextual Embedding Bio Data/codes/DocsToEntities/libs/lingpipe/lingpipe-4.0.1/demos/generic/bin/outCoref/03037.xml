<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> wants to be a lawyer, and <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX>'s doing it the old-fashioned way: <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX>'s an apprentice.</s>
<s i="2">Eight states still allow aspiring lawyers to take the bar exam without first getting law degrees, and about 200 people are currently in such programs.</s>
<s i="3">Requirements vary, but typically include three or four years of intense study under the supervision of an attorney.</s>
<s i="4">``It's the most logical way for me to get what I wanted,'' says <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Kunkel</ENAMEX>, a 40-year-old mother of three who started <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> apprenticeship in March.</s>
<s i="6">The high cost of tuition and the prospect of juggling classes and a 45-minute commute with family obligations all convinced <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> that law school was out of the question.</s>
<s i="7">Instead, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> works at least 25 hours a week at a small firm in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Barre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Vt.</ENAMEX>, doing legal research and drafting legal documents.</s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> rounds out <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> education by studying at home.</s>
<s i="9">After four years, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX>'ll be eligible to take the bar exam.</s>
<s i="10">Because Monika Lawless doesn't get paid for all the work <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> does at the law firm, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> also works part-time in the state <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court Administrator's Office</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="11">Skeptics say so-called readers of the law can be hampered by lax supervision and might not be exposed to the same breadth of subjects and experiences as they would in law school.</s>
<s i="12">Many readers fail the bar exam.</s>
<s i="13">And those who pass, skeptics say, often aren't qualified to do more than simple real estate transactions or divorce work.</s>
<s i="14">In <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>, even officials who oversee the reading program warn that, while it might seem glamorous to follow in the footsteps of <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey and Adalberto Lindsey</ENAMEX>, reading the law ``is not an equivalent alternative to law school for most people who want to practice law.'' But <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roberto E.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX>, who became a reader after first dropping out of law school and then being expelled for low grades when <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> tried law school again, passed the <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> bar exam on <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">Gray</ENAMEX> first try in 1978.</s>
<s i="16">Today <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> is a judge in the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="LOCATION">Bronx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Court</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> experience shows ``that if you really want something, you can get there different ways.'' Though law schools have been around since the early 1800s, most states didn't start requiring law degrees until the middle of this century.</s>
<s i="18">In fact, it wasn't until 1957 that the <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> for the first time was made up entirely of law school graduates.</s>
<s i="20">The <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>, which accredits law schools, says law grads are better prepared for the profession than readers.</s>
<s i="21">But <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> accepted a reader into its master's of law program in 1980 after putting the question of whether to admit someone who didn't already have a law degree to an unusual faculty vote.</s>
<s i="22">The reader, <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Yeager</ENAMEX>, now teaches at <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the University of Maryland School of Law</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="23">Supporters of the programs -- which continue in <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state and <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> -- say they provide an entree for those who might not otherwise consider the profession.</s>
<s i="24">(<ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> also allow people to read the law, but few people have taken that route in the past decade.) <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Nannette Johnston Chilton</ENAMEX>, who practices law with <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> husband, <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="PERSON">Marya</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, had dropped out of law school in <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to move west with <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> husband and raise their children.</s>
<s i="25">When <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> finally returned to the law a decade later, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> wanted flexibility and became a reader, working under the supervision of <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> husband.</s>
<s i="26"><ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Ahmed</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont</ENAMEX>'s defender general, the state's chief public defender, was an auto mechanic before pursuing a law career.</s>
<s i="27"><ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont Superior Court Epstein Elli Robertson Dunbar</ENAMEX> was a young widow with two children.</s>
<s i="28"><ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Sang Stefan</ENAMEX> was a single mother on welfare.</s>
<s i="29">Today, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> has a solo practice, works for a call-in service that provides legal advice for low-income people and holds a seat in the <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> legislature.</s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Monika Lawless</ENAMEX> is also supervising a reader, <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="PERSON">Barton Templin</ENAMEX>, a self-described ``outlaw hippie'' who says <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> previously tended to <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> garden and a cow on a rural commune and did odd jobs for neighbors.</s>
<s i="31">Like many apprentices, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Kunkel</ENAMEX> worries about being viewed ``within the larger legal community as a pretender.'' But in <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont</ENAMEX>, where the state's only law school wasn't founded until 1972, roughly half the readers who have taken the bar exam in recent years have passed, compared with rates as low as 19% elsewhere.</s>
<s i="33">Three current state judges were readers, as was the president-elect of the state bar association.</s>
<s i="34">The ranks of <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> readers even include a state <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> justice who served until 1980.</s>
<s i="35">``I couldn't manage otherwise,'' says <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">F.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="PERSON">Raylene Hardaway Sr.</ENAMEX>, who read the law after the financial pressures of raising a family forced <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> to forgo the expense of college.</s>
<s i="37">That was 70 years ago, before <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> joined the state <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in 1964.</s>
<s i="38">One of Gray colleagues on the high court was the late <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Rufina Johnetta</ENAMEX> Street, another reader who retired in 1980, five years after <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses Hardaway.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="39">``It's an opportunity for a poor person to make the grade,'' says <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="PERSON">Ulysses Hardaway.</ENAMEX>, who is now 98 years old.</s>
