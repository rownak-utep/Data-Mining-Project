<s i="1">``My diary was written not only from a need not to forget but also as a kind of warning: for those who have never left their homeland, for those who have never shed innocence, for those who cannot imagine the loss of freedom, this book is a reminder that there is another side of night.'' -- <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX>, from the foreword of ``Notes From the Other Side of <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Night'' As</ENAMEX> a teen-ager, Mrs.</s>
<s i="2">Avant and <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> family escaped <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halliburton's Romania</ENAMEX> and a decade ago wrote about a return trip.</s>
<s i="3">Vigilant as <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> might have been about governments that persecute, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Mrs.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="4">Avant could not have imagined the nightmare <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> husband, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Roland</ENAMEX>, would endure because of the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government, because of <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> no less.</s>
<s i="5">The story of what happened to the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> is partly a tale of how people in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> can be victims of <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">``ethics</ENAMEX>'' charges.</s>
<s i="6">They were falsely and publicly cited in an ethics report by <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> for the serious crime of leaking classified documents to the South African government.</s>
<s i="7">The most curious aspect of the case is that this report was issued after <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> had cleared the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>
To <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> credit, Attorney General Dillon <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> last month approved an apology to the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> and an unprecedented $25,000 settlement.</s>
<s i="8">On the other hand, the problem remains of unexplained misfeasance -- or malfeasance -- by ethics officers whose power shields them from internal scrutiny.</s>
<s i="9">Pilons were central-casting quality young <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Reaganites</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="10">They met as philosophy graduate students at <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the University of Chicago.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11">When they came to <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Mrs.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12">Avant served in several positions, including head of <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asylum Policy and Review office</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="13">The trouble began in 1987 when <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mrs</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX>, who was at the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>, was nominated to become an assistant secretary of the interior.</s>
<s i="15">There was a problem in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX> background check.</s>
<s i="16">The <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> set up simultaneous but separate interviews with the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>, demanding to know if <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mrs
Avant</ENAMEX> had leaked to <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> wife a <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> document, ``Report to <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on Communist Influence in <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>.'' <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX> was asked if <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX> then passed it on to a South African diplomat.</s>
<s i="17">Both denied the accusations, but according to the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>, officers from <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s ethics office, the Office of Professional Responsibility, told <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avant Mr.</ENAMEX> security clearance had been lifted and <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> was put on leave.</s>
<s i="19">Mrs.</s>
<s i="20">Avant's nomination was eventually withdrawn.</s>
<s i="21">Finally, the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> say, ethics chief <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX> told Mr.</s>
<s i="22">Avant to resign or be fired.</s>
<s i="23"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>' lawyer, <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Terresa O'Donya</ENAMEX>, proposed that <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> be allowed to see the evidence and produce a classified rebuttal.</s>
<s i="24"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Terresa O'Donya</ENAMEX>'s report went all the way to Attorney General <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="PERSON">Efren Laboy</ENAMEX>, who ordered a review of the allegations.</s>
<s i="26">In September 1988, a top <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> aide, <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="PERSON">Deeanna Bowen</ENAMEX>, sent a letter dropping all charges and reinstating Mr.</s>
<s i="27"><ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Avant.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="28">The letter said <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">``</ENAMEX>no implications adverse to you should be taken,'' thanking Mr. <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="PERSON">for</ENAMEX> ``the outstanding cooperation and patience you have demonstrated.'' Mrs.</s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Avant.</ENAMEX>, who now runs the <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Forum Foundation</ENAMEX>, guesses that the <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> wiretapped a conversation in which <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX> offered a South African diplomat a copy of a <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX> study about Soviet activity at the <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="31"><ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Avant</ENAMEX>, who is now with the <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CATO Institute</ENAMEX>, recalls that the investigation ``was so psychologically debilitating because we were never told what the problem was, and so were always flailing at shadows.'' The most bizarre aspect of what the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> call their Kafkaesque experience is that it only got worse after the charges were dropped.</s>
<s i="32">This past November, <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="33"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX>'s office issued its annual report on ethics investigations.</s>
<s i="34">It described four ``representative'' investigations of the more than 400 conducted during the year.</s>
<s i="35">The first described a Justice lawyer who ``was the subject of a foreign counterintelligence investigation.'' The report said the investigation found ``that sufficient cause existed to terminate Mr. political apppointment.'' No names were used, but reporters quickly learned it referred to <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="LOCATION">Avant.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="37">This was the first public mention of the case.</s>
<s i="38">Pilons were outraged.</s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="40">Avant told a congressional committee that power had ``corrupted'' <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="41"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="42"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="43"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> deputy, <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donetta Alva</ENAMEX>, investigate.</s>
<s i="44">This past March the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> were cleared for the second time, with <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="45"><ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Donetta Alva</ENAMEX> noting that <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="46">Avant had returned to Mr. <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="PERSON">job</ENAMEX> ``unconditionally.'' <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="47"><ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Donetta Alva</ENAMEX> then sent a follow-up letter in April saying that ``the <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> report was erroneous in certain particulars, but that <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> cannot be faulted in any way.'' This did more than leave open the question of whose fault it was.</s>
<s i="48"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="49"><ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Donetta Alva</ENAMEX> was soon forced to resign in part, according to <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="50"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>'s aides, because Mr. <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="PERSON">had</ENAMEX> no authorization to clear <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="51"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="52"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="53"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> ordered a third review of the case.</s>
<s i="54">The latest apology plus the cash settlement was issued by Assistant Attorney General <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Sunni Scheel</ENAMEX>, who says <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> wanted to <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">``do</ENAMEX> the fair thing'' by covering the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>' legal costs.</s>
<s i="55">The mystery remains how the ethics office could have issued a report smearing the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX>
Ethics officials knew the details of the case.</s>
<s i="56"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="57"><ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="PERSON">Deeanna Bowen</ENAMEX>, who is now the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="58">Attorney in <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, confirms that Mr. <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="PERSON">had</ENAMEX> informed representatives from the ethics office back in September 1988, that the investigation of <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Pilons</ENAMEX> had ended with no evidence of wrongdoing.</s>
<s i="59">If <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="60"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX> issued the annual report despite knowledge that <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="61">Avant had been cleared, this might be a case of <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="62"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="63"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="64"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX> has been the only director of the post-Watergate ethics office, which was formed in 1976.</s>
<s i="65">Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity.</s>
<s i="66"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="67"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX> did not return phone calls.</s>
<s i="68">No one at <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Justice Department</ENAMEX> seems very interested in digging deeper to find out how the false ethics report could have been issued.</s>
<s i="69">They may not want to be accused of somehow interfering.</s>
<s i="70">Or maybe they fear being smeared themselves; the ethics office has initiated investigations of several past attorneys general.</s>
<s i="71">It's worth noting, though, that <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="72"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Schaffner</ENAMEX>'s office may be redundant.</s>
<s i="73">Last year, <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> forced several departments, including <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, to create an office of inspector general to investigate alleged wrongdoing.</s>
<s i="74"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="75">Avant would like to get to the bottom of all this and says, ``it is appalling that there are not better institutional protections against this kind of abuse.'' Mrs.</s>
<s i="76">Avant's book meanwhile will be published this year in <ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="77">Maybe <ENAMEX ID="44" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann Avant</ENAMEX> should add a postscript reminding the newly liberated countries that justice does not always come easily even in the most advanced nations.</s>
