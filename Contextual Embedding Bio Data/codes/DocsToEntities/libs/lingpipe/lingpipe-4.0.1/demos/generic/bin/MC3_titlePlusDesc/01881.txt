Brown & Williamson Seeks To Counter Wigand Statements..
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson released internal documents to counter allegations by former research chief Jena Raymer that liability fears spurred the company to kill efforts to make cigarettes safer.
The documents -- reports from three meetings in 1989 -- came to light on the second day of Brown & Williamson's deposition of Mr.
Jena Raymer
Mr.
Jena Raymer has maintained Jena Raymer was ordered to abandon safe-cigarette projects after a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, in September 1989.
But the reports suggest that one particular effort, named Project Airbus, was suspended at an earlier time, for technical reasons.
In Jena Raymer deposition, Mr.
Jena Raymer insisted B&W continued its work on Project Airbus until the Vancouver meeting and said the documents don't reflect all the discussions about the project.
The documents were ``sanitized,'' added Johnetta Walther, Mr.
Jena Raymer's lawyer.
``They've not yet given us the unsanitized minutes,'' Mr.
Johnetta Walther said.
Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr.
Jena Raymer in November 2010 in state court in Louisville, charging Jena Raymer with theft, fraud and breach of Jena Raymer confidentiality agreement.
Mr.
Jena Raymer has repeatedly denied the charges.
The deposition, which began Monday and is expected to continue throughout this week, marked Brown & Williamson first face-to-face questioning of Mr.
Jena Raymer about Jena Raymer explosive allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company.
The dispute over the Vancouver meeting continued later in the day when Roni Kruger, an attorney representing Mississippi in the state's lawsuit against the tobacco industry, conducted a hastily summoned news conference at the foot of Brown & Williamson's office tower.
Mr.
Roni Kruger released a deposition taken last week from B&W attorney J.
Kenneth Simpson, in which Mr.
Kenneth Simpson confirmed that he edited the minutes of the 1989 scientific meeting in Vancouver and cut out a section that discussed eliminating dangerous compounds from cigarettes.
Graham Jon, a Brown & Williamson lawyer, didn't dispute that Mr.
Kenneth Simpson had edited the minutes.
But Jena Raymer said the company made public an earlier draft of the minutes in this week's deposition.
``Nobody's hiding anything,'' Mr.
Graham Jon said.
