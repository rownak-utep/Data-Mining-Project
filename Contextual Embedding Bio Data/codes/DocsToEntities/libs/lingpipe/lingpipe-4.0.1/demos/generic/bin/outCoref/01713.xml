<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX> temporarily pulled ads for its Trooper sport-utility vehicle after Consumer Reports said the vehicle could tend to roll over when drivers make sharp lane changes.</s>
<s i="2">The ads, which an <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said were scheduled to run this week in <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">The Vast</ENAMEX> Press and on some premium cable networks, will be replaced with ads for <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Vega</ENAMEX>'s less pricey Rodeo sport-utility vehicle, said <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Tess Dunbar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX>'s general manager for sales and marketing.</s>
<s i="3">``Because of the particular TV coverage we're getting, we're taking a short hiatus,'' <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Tess Dunbar</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="5">``It's not a good time to spend advertising dollars.'' The campaign, launched during the <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Games</ENAMEX> and created by <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Goodby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silverstein &amp; Partners</ENAMEX>, features an <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX> in natural settings and is expected to resume before <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Day</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX> officials said.</s>
<s i="6">Tuesday, Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, called for an immediate recall of 2010 and 2011 <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors Troopers</ENAMEX> and the 2011 Acura <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLX</ENAMEX>, which is also manufactured by <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX>
The consumer group said the vehicles tipped too high during road-handling tests -- a problem that could make them turn over.</s>
<s i="7">Officials from <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor</ENAMEX>, said the company has no plans to alter its advertising strategy because it has sold only 2,000 <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLXs</ENAMEX> since the luxury sport-utility vehicles were launched last November.</s>
<s i="8">``The <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLX</ENAMEX> essentially represents 2% to 3% of <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX>'s sales,'' while the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trooper</ENAMEX>'s sales represent a significantly higher percentage for <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Kozlowski</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX> officials say an advertising campaign scheduled to start this fall is still in place, but the content of the ad hasn't been decided.</s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Fathom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> ad agency for the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLX</ENAMEX>, declined to comment.</s>
<s i="11">Marketing and automotive specialists split on the wisdom of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX>'s strategy to change its ads.</s>
<s i="12">``It's a good decision,'' says <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Gaye Santina</ENAMEX>, founder and principal of the <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Westport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13">``The last thing you want to do is stand in front of a moving freight train.</s>
<s i="14">Any ad money they spend right now would remind consumers of the controversy.'' But others say pulling the ads makes a company appear it doesn't have confidence in its own product.</s>
<s i="15">``If you really believe in the product, then don't change from what you're doing,'' says <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrystal W.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX> maintains that it has confidence in its product and notes that the vehicle has passed all federal safety standards.</s>
<s i="18">It also said it welcomes the consumer group's invitation to examine the testing and engineering of the vehicles.</s>
<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu Motors</ENAMEX>'s reaction differs sharply from that of the last sport-utility-vehicle maker that faced a similar claim.</s>
<s i="20">When Consumer Reports said the <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Suzuki Samurai</ENAMEX> might tip on sharp turns in 1988, <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Suzuki</ENAMEX> Samurai <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motors</ENAMEX> kept advertising the vehicle and held news conference saying the consumer group's test wasn't valid under real road conditions.</s>
<s i="21">Sales of the <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Suzuki Samurai</ENAMEX> plunged to 1,435 in the 1989 model year from 77,493 units in 1988.</s>
<s i="22">An attorney for <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="PERSON">Russel</ENAMEX> said the company filed a lawsuit against Consumers Union in federal court in <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> in April, alleging defamation.</s>

<s i="24">Earlier this year, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> ran a Chivas Regal ad developed by <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="PERSON">Wofford</ENAMEX> Advertising on an <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, breaking with industry's decades-old voluntary ban on TV spots in the <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="26">The <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="PERSON">Smirnoff Vodka</ENAMEX> ads, which can be downloaded from the <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internet</ENAMEX>, air on British television and were created by <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowe Howard-Spink</ENAMEX> unit.</s>
