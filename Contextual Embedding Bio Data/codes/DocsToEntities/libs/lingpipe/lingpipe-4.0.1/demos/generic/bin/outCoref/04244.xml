<s i="1">NEW <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YORK</ENAMEX> -- A big French tobacco concern sued <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX>, alleging that the investment bank recommended risky derivatives trades that triggered losses of $29.8 million.</s>
<s i="2">In the suit, filed in state court here, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hidalgo Crotty d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Seita</ENAMEX>) accused <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and two units of breaching their fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of contract in connection with two derivatives swaps that <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon sold Seita</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="3">For its part, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX> is an experienced and sophisticated market participant who is trying to use the courts to reverse a losing trade.</s>
<s i="4">We think their claim will fail again.'' (<ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX> had filed a suit against <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> in federal court in <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YORK</ENAMEX> last fall that was dismissed on grounds of lack of jurisdiction.) The action is the latest in a string of suits filed by corporate clients, including such giants as <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</ENAMEX>, against Wall Street securities firms for derivatives-related losses.</s>
<s i="5">Derivatives are financial agreements whose returns are linked to, or derived from, the performance of some underlying asset, such as bonds, currencies or commodities.</s>
<s i="6">``There has been an explosion in the derivatives market since the late ``80s and the experience of suing has proved profitable for some corporations,'' said <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Bushey</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University Law School</ENAMEX> professor.</s>
<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Wm Herma Gaona</ENAMEX>, a law professor at <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>: ``To be able to try to argue that the derivatives dealer misled me provides you with a bit of <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">cover.'' Seita</ENAMEX>'s claims stem from a $35 million (notional, or total amount) mark interest-rate swap, sold by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> to Seita on October 12, 2008 and a $15 million (notional) <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="8">dollar/Japanese yen exchange-rate swap, sold by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> on October 19, 2008 Both swaps were restructured several times.</s>
<s i="9">According to the suit, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">Gagliano Cork</ENAMEX>, then a vice president at <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ENAMEX>, proposed the swap products in late 1993 to <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Purser</ENAMEX>, then treasurer at <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11">Purser, the suit said, didn't initially agree to the swap transactions but ``only agreed to them after repeated calls from Albou aggressively promoting the transactions.'' Meanwhile, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX>, the suit said, failed to disclose the risks of the swaps to <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX>, the possibility of losses in principal and the speed at which the swaps could decline in value.</s>
<s i="12">In addition, the suit said that <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13">Cork didn't disclose to <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Seita</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">Riles</ENAMEX>, as counterparty on the swap, stood to gain from losses suffered by <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX>
``These undisclosed factors provided incentive for, and caused <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> to structure, price and value the swap transactions disproportionately in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX>'s favor and against the interests of its customer, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX>,'' according to the suit, which was reported in <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">La</ENAMEX> Tribune Desfosses, a French business publication.</s>
<s i="14">Soon after <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> arranged the swaps for <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX>, the losses started to mount, the suit alleged.</s>
<s i="15">On November 13, 2008 <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Riles</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX> the dollar-yen swap already had losses of $7.8 million, according to the suit.</s>
<s i="16">By December 01, 2010 was informed the mark swap had losses of $14 million.</s>
