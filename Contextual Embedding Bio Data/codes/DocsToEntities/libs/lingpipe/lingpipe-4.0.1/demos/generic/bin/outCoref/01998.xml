<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX> -- Saying ``deadly criminals don't stay within state <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lines</ENAMEX>,'' President <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> acted Saturday to establish a national registry to track sex offenders.</s>
<s i="2">``This national registry sends a simple message to those who would prey on our children: The law will follow you wherever you go,'' <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="3"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Codi</ENAMEX> weekly radio address.</s>
<s i="4">It was the latest in a flurry of actions leading up to the Democratic National Convention.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> last week signed bills increasing the minimum wage, allowing workers to bring along their health insurance when they change jobs and overhauling the welfare system.</s>
<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> also announced a major crackdown on tobacco.</s>
<s i="8">The president is to board a campaign train in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> Sunday and head to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, where on Thursday night <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> will accept Codi party's presidential nomination for the second time.</s>
<s i="9">In the radio address, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> said the national registry of sexual offenders is a necessary step.</s>
<s i="11">``Deadly criminals don't stay within state lines, so neither should law enforcement's tools to stop them,'' <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Codi said.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13">The new effort, which <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> set in motion 60 days ago, follows a provision in an administration crime bill that requires all states to keep track of sex offenders.</s>
<s i="15">The Republican-controlled <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> also approved legislation last month to set up a national registry to be operated by the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="16">Rival Bobby <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Derryberry</ENAMEX>'s campaign promptly accused <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> of stealing the idea from the <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>, which included a registry in its 1992 party platform.</s>
<s i="18">``<ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> has mastered the game of follow the leader -- Bobby <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Derryberry</ENAMEX>'' said campaign spokeswoman <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Christinia Martine</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="19">The registry also is the product of the so-called <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Megan</ENAMEX>'s Law, which requires communities to be notified if sex offenders move into a neighborhood.</s>
<s i="20">The law is named for a <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> girl whose accused killer was a neighbor whose conviction for sexual violence was unknown to <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> family.</s>
<s i="21">``We are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals, not just in a single state but wherever they go -- so that parents and police have the warning they need to protect our children,'' said <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX>, who noted that studies indicate sex offenders often repeat their crimes.</s>
<s i="23">``Nothing is more threatening to our families and communities and more destructive of our basic values than sex offenders who victimize children in their families,'' <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> said, calling the registry a way ``to make our children safe and give their parents peace of <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">mind.</ENAMEX>'' There are an estimated 250,000 people either wanted for sex offenses or who have a criminal record of such crimes, said Associate Attorney General <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Vasquez</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="24">But <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Vasquez</ENAMEX> said that number may well increase when the national registry is completed.</s>
<s i="26">The registry is expected to cost about $2 million, with states incurring an additional but relatively modest cost, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>

A Justice Department</ENAMEX> report, also released Saturday, counted 312,000 reported rapes and 173,000 other sexual assaults in 1993, the latest statistics available.</s>
<s i="28">In a 15-year study by the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Department of Justice</ENAMEX>, nearly 20% of 1,362 sexual offenders arrested in 1973 were re-arrested for a later sexual offense, the report said.</s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> studies show released rapists were 10.5 times more likely to be rearrested for rape than were other released prisoners, it said.</s>
<s i="30">``Offenders against children present an even higher rate of recidivism,'' the report said.</s>
<s i="31">A recent Justice survey found ``offenders against children were more than twice as likely to have multiple victims as offenders committing crimes against adults.'' Under <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX>'s plan, convicted sex offenders released from jail will be compelled by state authorities to register their address and other information.</s>
<s i="33">The <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> will compile the state lists into a national database.</s>
<s i="34">Then, when it becomes operational in about six months, a new federal computer network will permit law enforcement authorities in one state to obtain criminal record information on sex offenders from every other state.</s>
