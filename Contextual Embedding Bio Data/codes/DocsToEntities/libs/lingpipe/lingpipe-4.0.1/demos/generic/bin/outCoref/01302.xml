<s i="1">SINGAPORE -- In its first action since assuming powers this week to police the Internet, the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Broadcasting Authority</ENAMEX> has yanked off a newsgroup's posting that criticized some lawyers, a newspaper reported Friday.</s>
<s i="2">The <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> acted on a complaint by an unidentified law firm, which said the contents of the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">anonymous</ENAMEX> posting defamed some of its lawyers in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, according to a report in the Straits <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> newspaper Friday.</s>
<s i="3">The newspaper said the posting on the newsgroup was apparently made by a disgruntled client who claimed anonymous lost a case even though anonymous lawyers told <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">anonymous anonymous</ENAMEX> could win it.</s>
<s i="4">The client also questioned the ability of the lawyers who belongs to one of the oldest firms in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">the Straits</ENAMEX> Times said.</s>
<s i="5">Under new <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> regulations that came into effect Monday, the government agency has the power to ask Internet service providers to remove material that it considers objectionable.</s>
<s i="6">A government-appointed panel of prominent citizens decides what is objectionable.</s>
<s i="7">The Straits <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said the posting is believed to have been made from the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which means the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>, in keeping with its own rules, will not be able to take action against the offender.</s>
<s i="8">The <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> says its rules are mainly directed against pornography, anti-government or seditious views, racially motivated slurs and articles that could inflame religious passions.</s>
<s i="9">Since Monday, Internet providers, political parties that maintain <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> sites, groups and individuals who run discussion sites on politics and religion, and on-line newspapers are deemed to have become automatically licensed.</s>
<s i="10">This means refusal to follow the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> rules will result in fines.</s>
<s i="11">The amounts are yet to be determined.</s>
