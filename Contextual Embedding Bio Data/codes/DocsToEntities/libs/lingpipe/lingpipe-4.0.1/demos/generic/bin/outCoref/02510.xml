<s i="1">A federal bankruptcy court judge approved a settlement that provides a partial refund to the hundreds of victims of <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Foundation</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX></s> <s i="2">Philanthropy fraud scheme.</s>
<s i="3">Under the settlement, agreed to last week by <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Bryan Rob</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, hundreds of charities, churches, colleges and other nonprofit groups that lost money would receive an estimated 65 cents for each dollar of their losses.</s>
<s i="4">The money -- at least $39 million in all -- would be paid by other participants in the scheme that came out ahead.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Radnor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, collected millions of dollars from nonprofit groups with the promise that their funds would be doubled by a small group of wealthy, anonymous donors.</s>
<s i="6">But the donors didn't exist, and federal and state authorities say <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX> was a giant <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponzi</ENAMEX> scheme, in which early participants are paid off with the proceeds of later ones.</s>
<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX>'s collapse into bankruptcy proceedings in May 2010 became one of the biggest scandals in the annals of philanthropy.</s>
<s i="8">Attorneys for <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX>'s bankruptcy trustee, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Waiters</ENAMEX> M.</s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>, hope that with <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Bryan Rob</ENAMEX>'s decision, the monetary redistribution can take place by the end of the year.</s>
<s i="10">But at least one possible roadblock looms -- a potential appeal by <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>, which handled much of <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX>'s money.</s>
<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="12">In June, <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> sued the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage firm, alleging it overlooked repeated and obvious signs that <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX> was fraudulent out of a desire to earn commissions and ``excessive'' interest.</s>
<s i="14">The suit seeks the return of $160 million in funds that Prudential loaned <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Era Fraud..</ENAMEX> or held for it in a brokerage account.</s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX>, which has termed the lawsuit meritless, objects to the trustee's settlement with the charities, arguing that the nonprofit groups that came out ahead in the scheme should return all of the money, not a portion.</s>
<s i="16">``If everyone returned the profits, there would be no need to sue us,'' said <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Charlette Spencer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> spokesman.</s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Charlette Spencer</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential ``</ENAMEX>considering appealing'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Bryan Rob</ENAMEX>'s approval of the settlement, but has made no final decision.</s>
<s i="18">Many attorneys involved in the complex case privately hope <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> won't appeal, given the months of tough negotiations it took to work out the settlement.</s>
<s i="19">``This case had the potential to deteriorate into a litigation meltdown'' with charities suing each other, says <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta Abbie</ENAMEX>, an attorney for the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud</ENAMEX>.. trustee.</s>
<s i="20">It was the chance to avoid protracted litigation that prompted many nonprofit groups to agree to accept a partial refund, says attorney <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Michaele A.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="21"><ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX>, who represents the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> chapters of the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> and several other organizations that lost money in the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era Fraud</ENAMEX>.. debacle.</s>
<s i="22">``All of my clients are relieved,'' <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Charlette Spencer</ENAMEX> said, adding, ``All the charities, whether they came out ahead or behind, clearly have been damaged.''</s>
