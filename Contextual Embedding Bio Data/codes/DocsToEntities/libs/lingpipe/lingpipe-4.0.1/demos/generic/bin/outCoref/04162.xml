<s i="1">With four months until the Legislature meets, a battle already is taking shape over what promises to be among the most contentious business issues of the next session: Whether <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> can be sued for medical malpractice.</s>
<s i="2">Physicians and trial lawyers are weighing an assault on the legal status quo, which they say unfairly protects health maintenance organizations from liability in malpractice lawsuits.</s>
<s i="3"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX>, in their defense, claim they shouldn't bear responsibility for the decisions and actions of professionals they don't control, and they already are campaigning against the idea of ``shared liability.'' It's too early to predict the outcome.</s>
<s i="4">However, the outlines of the looming legislative battle should become clearer late next month, when an interim <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee studying potential managed-care legislation will meet in <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="5">For now, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Sen.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Waco</ENAMEX>, the panel's chairman, says <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> isn't yet sure if the issue will be part of the committee's legislative recommendations.</s>
<s i="7">``There are two sides to it,'' <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="8">``Maybe even three or four.'' Under both state and federal law, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and most other states generally have been exempt from liability in malpractice lawsuits.</s>
<s i="9">But the laws were drafted long before managed-care companies had gained the large presence they now command in the health-care field.</s>
<s i="10">So as managed-care companies have continued to expand, the debate about their potential share of liability in malpractice cases has only increased in volume.</s>
<s i="11">To date, managed-care companies have sought refuge from malpractice suits in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> under two laws.</s>
<s i="12">One of them is the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> Practices Act, which prohibits nonphysicians from practicing medicine.</s>
<s i="13">Since <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> aren't operated by physicians, they can't practice medicine and therefore can't be held liable for medical decisions.</s>
<s i="14">In addition, a 1974 federal law exempts self-insured, employer-provided health plans from most liability for coverage and treatment decisions.</s>
<s i="15">Physicians and trial lawyers argue that the laws ignore the contemporary reality of health care.</s>
<s i="16">True, they say, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> don't actually practice medicine.</s>
<s i="17">But in a number of instances, they argue, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> are influencing the practice of medicine by deciding whether certain treatments are covered or not, and how much they will pay for some treatments.</s>
<s i="18">``It's one thing for a doctor to have to eat a $50 bill to set a broken leg,'' says <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consuela Middleton</ENAMEX>, associate legislative director for the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, which represents most of the state's physicians.</s>
<s i="19">``But it's another thing entirely for them to try and figure out how to get a $200,000 bone-marrow transplant done when the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> won't pay for <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">it.</ENAMEX>'' The managed-care industry counters that physicians want to shift all of the liability for medical decisions to <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> without giving them the authority to make those decisions, maintaining that <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> don't prescribe treatment.</s>
<s i="20">``They're calling it `shared liability,' but that's not how it would work,'' says <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Tommie Cameron</ENAMEX>, chief lawyer for the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas HMO Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="21">``If this goes through, you'll see plaintiffs' lawyers striking deals with the doctors to go after the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX>
And the cost of medicine will go up.'' In some other states, a few pending malpractice suits against <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> could create precedents under existing state and federal laws, which in some instances do leave room for extending liability to <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">HMOs
Jena Lum</ENAMEX>, vice president for legal affairs at <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA Health Plans of Texas Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, says that forced to choose, <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> would rather see the issue decided in the courts than by legislative fiat.</s>
<s i="22">``That's the appropriate place for it,'' <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="23"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Whittaker</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> attorney whose firm has won three of four multimillion-dollar malpractice verdicts returned in <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="LOCATION">Harris County</ENAMEX> in the past year, says managed-care officials should be careful what they ask for.</s>
<s i="24">Last month, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Whittaker</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> tried a case in which a woman had an unnecessary mastectomy.</s>
<s i="26">Potential jurors, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> says, wanted to know if an <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> had been involved.</s>
<s i="27">(One hadn't.) ``People are very conscious of the fact that <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> are a disguised effort to lower the level of medical care,'' says <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="28"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Whittaker</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="29">``And more and more people are becoming members of <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX>
So I think we're reaching a level of critical mass in dealing with them.'' Critical enough, in fact, for lawmakers to be taking up the issue.</s>
<s i="30">Earlier this year, the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Legislature approved a law that would have allowed patients to sue their <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> when they have been denied necessary treatment or services.</s>
<s i="31">Gov.</s>
<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Whiting Buell</ENAMEX> vetoed the bill, saying it would be too costly.</s>
<s i="33"><ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> officials say such legislation wouldn't just raise health-care costs by forcing them to defend more of their decisions in court.</s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="35"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Tommie Cameron</ENAMEX> says it also would force doctors to practice ``defensive medicine,'' ordering unnecessary tests to guard against potential lawsuits.</s>
<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Mejias</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houston Area Health Care Coalition</ENAMEX>, an alliance of large employers seeking to reduce <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> costs, says such legislation could leave employers legally vulnerable, too.</s>
<s i="37">``Employers have got to be the next step after managed-care organizations, since employees can say that they chose the <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">HMO Davina Schubert</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="38">``So I'd consider this to be a dangerous precedent.'' <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consuela Middleton</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> says shared liability would nonetheless improve the overall quality of health care.</s>
<s i="40">By forcing managed-care organizations to bear some responsibility for health-care decisions they in effect make, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX> says, ``perhaps they won't be so cavalier in denying these treatments.''</s>
