Stocks Rise on Strong Dollar..
The AEX index of 25 leading shares advanced 3.99 to 554.98 points.
Volume was low and the lack of activity was partly explained by the absence of U.S. markets for the Labor Day holiday.
The dollar, at 11:00 a.m.
EDT, traded at 1.6659 guilders, up from 1.6573 guilders late Friday.
The Dutch stock market is highly dollar-sensitive as a number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
