Keating Will Cheer His Grandson From Jail With Fellow Prisoners..
Vastopolis. -- When Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. hits the pool, cheering Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. on from behind the bars of a federal prison will be Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. grandfather -- former financier Charlette Gatlin.
Since dedicating Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. races at the Games trials in March to Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. grandfather and 48 other inmates at a Federal Correctional Institution south of Vastopolis, Allena likes to joke that Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. is swimming's ``bad boy'' with fans like ``Mister Dice'' and ``Big Red.'' ``The fact is, I'm in prison, but Gay shouldn't let that bother Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr.,'' said Charlette Gatlin.
``I think it just adds to Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. desire.
Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr.'s going to need some guts and desire to go a few extra hundredths of a second faster.'' Gay Allena Jr.
