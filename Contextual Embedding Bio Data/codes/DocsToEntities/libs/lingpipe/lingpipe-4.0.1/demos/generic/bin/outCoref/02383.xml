<s i="1">While other flabby, middle-aged men were trying to jump-start their virility by acquiring trophy wives, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX> was drawing up <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The List</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="2">No, not ``visit <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, lose five pounds, improve my putting.'' Scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin after enough beer to dull the part of the brain that dispenses common sense, The List looks like this: 1) Windsurf <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Air</ENAMEX>; 2) <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Kamikaze Downhill</ENAMEX>; 3) Escape From <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Alcatraz</ENAMEX>; 4) Whitewater off a Waterfall; 5) Rock Climb; 6) Cave Dive; 7) Ice Climb; 8) Skydive; 9) Skate <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon;</ENAMEX> 10) Dive Really Deep; 11) Badwater <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Death Valley</ENAMEX> Run; 12) Iditarod <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Bike Race</ENAMEX>; 13) Boles.</s>
<s i="3">Even in an age of cross-training super-athletes, this list borders on the suicidal.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scaling Regan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Martindale Melvin</ENAMEX>), ``the roof of the world,'' claims the life of one out of every 100 climbers who try.</s>
<s i="5">Cave-diving, which involves exploring caverns beneath the sea, has been called the most dangerous sport in the world.</s>
<s i="6">The <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Badwater Run</ENAMEX> drags competitors from the lowest point in the continental <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to the highest, with temperatures ranging from 125 degrees at the start in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Death Valley</ENAMEX> to freezing at the <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Whitney</ENAMEX> finish.</s>
<s i="7">Other challenges from The List include a mile-and-a-half swim through shark-infested waters (part of the <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Alcatraz</ENAMEX>), a plunge off a waterfall in a rubber <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">kayak</ENAMEX>, and a race where the motto is ``Cowards won't show, and the weak will die'' (the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bike Race</ENAMEX>).</s>
<s i="8">If you drew up such a list one boozy night, you might discreetly crumple it up after you read it in the sober light of day.</s>
<s i="9">Instead, the author threw himself into the enterprise full-bore.</s>
<s i="10">Makes you wonder about <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> brand of brew.</s>
<s i="11">Oh sure, you're saying, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX> is probably the second coming of <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joi Sprouse</ENAMEX>, with a body tuned to a perfect pitch by hours of daily exercise.</s>
<s i="12">Not close.</s>
<s i="13">At the beginning of this adventure--detailed entertainingly in ``Over the Edge: <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Regular Guy</ENAMEX>'s Odyssey in Extreme <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Sports</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>, 246 pages, $21.95)--our eccentric hero can't run more than a mile without collapsing and can't swim at all.</s>
<s i="14">Sports is afraid of heights and has none of the technical expertise on which Sports life will depend when scaling a frozen waterfall or diving at seven atmospheres.</s>
<s i="15">In short, <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>'s more or less like you and me.</s>
<s i="16">Some of <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX>'s achievements are the product of sheer courage, like the <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Kamikaze Downhill</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="18">The most dangerous organized sporting event in <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> based on total number of injuries, this 3.5-mile bicycle race forces competitors straight down a mountain at speeds up to 60 miles an hour.</s>
<s i="19">Others test brute will, like the <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Alcatraz</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Bike Race</ENAMEX>, where cold, distance and terror conspire to break challengers mentally as well as physically.</s>
<s i="20">As if trading in <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="LOCATION">Sports</ENAMEX> Dockers for high-tech ``clothing systems'' isn't enough, <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="21"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX> must also figure out what Sports calls ``the details of staying alive.'' In the course of Sports adventures, Sports masters the use of an <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ice</ENAMEX> ax as well as a dive computer.</s>
<s i="22">Sports learns how to locate and rescue colleagues buried by avalanches, avoid nitrogen narcosis and deal with the ever-present risk of moose attack.</s>
<s i="23">A couple of items on <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The List</ENAMEX>, though, require only the willingness to do something entirely counterintuitive (read: ``totally nuts'').</s>
<s i="24"><ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Rollerblade</ENAMEX> 85 miles in urban traffic?</s>
<s i="25">Windsurf in gale-force winds?</s>
<s i="26">Pass the remote and I'll watch it on <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="27">``Over the Edge'' does give you an increased appreciation of the human body's physical and mental capabilities.</s>
<s i="28">There is something undeniably bracing about seeing the limits of human endurance pushed out, a feeling that those doing the pushing call ``the <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">rush.</ENAMEX>'' Having leapt backward off a 150-foot tower with a rubberband tied to my ankles, I have tasted the rush and understand how addictive it can be.</s>
<s i="29">What I was hoping to find in this book was some insight into why some people can't satisfy their craving for excitement on weekends.</s>
<s i="30">How did <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX> become the <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgeann Harkness</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="PERSON">hell</ENAMEX>?</s>
<s i="31">The answer is elusive.</s>
<s i="32">``There is no easy way into another world,'' someone once wrote, and this truth leaps from the pages of ``Over the Edge.'' Forcing yourself into the extreme gives you a perspective inaccessible to those who haven't been there.</s>
<s i="33">Reading ``Over the Edge'' is a good way to enjoy <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX>'s exploits.</s>
<s i="34">But to understand Sports, you've got to follow Sports there.</s>
<s i="35">Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting you put down the <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nachos and</ENAMEX> turn your life over to a personal trainer.</s>
<s i="36">Some experiences are best enjoyed vicariously, particularly when you must sign a waiver of liability as a condition for participating.</s>
<s i="37">But if you are one of the hardy few who can't stand to let <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Zachary</ENAMEX> have all the thrills, just remember: When your lawyer comes looking for a deep pocket, I'll deny you heard about <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The List</ENAMEX> from me.</s>
<s i="38"><ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Colton</ENAMEX> is a federal judge in <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.</s>
