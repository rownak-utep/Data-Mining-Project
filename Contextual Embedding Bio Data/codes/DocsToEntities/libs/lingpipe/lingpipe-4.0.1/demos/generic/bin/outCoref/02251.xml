<s i="1">In 1991, a <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Shadow driven by <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crump</ENAMEX> bumped into a curb at a bank parking lot, setting off the car's air bag and breaking Mr.</s>
<s i="3"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Crump</ENAMEX>'s watch and <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">eyeglasses</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="4">Though uninjured except for periodic ringing in eyeglasses ears, the 52-year-old employee of a <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> dealer in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, sued the auto maker for $20,000.</s>
<s i="5">Figuring a few thousand dollars would mean little to <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Crump</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">eyeglasses</ENAMEX> expected it to bluster a little and then quietly pay up.</s>
<s i="7">Instead, it brought in company engineers and outside counsel to fight the claim -- repeatedly inspecting the car, collecting depositions and filing motions on everything from the qualifications of the plaintiff's expert to the location of pretrial proceedings.</s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spent three years and tens of thousands of dollars to fight the claim, even though <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Crump</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Randazzo</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> would have settled for less than $5,000.</s>
<s i="11">On April 07, 2011 efforts paid off: A state-court judge in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsfield</ENAMEX> granted its motion for summary judgment.</s>
<s i="12">The company will defend air-bag cases ``if it's one cent or one million dollars,'' <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Randazzo</ENAMEX> believes.</s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Karleen Lebel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> attorney, doesn't dispute that assessment: ``Cost is no object in these cases.'' Many <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Victories General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> also have dug in their heels, electing to fight such claims far more often than to settle.</s>
<s i="15">And so far, surprisingly, they are winning most air-bag cases, according to their own tallies and independent legal authorities.</s>
<s i="16">And that's despite expressions of concern by federal safety authorities and a recent spate of news reports of children and even some adults being maimed or killed by the supposedly lifesaving air bags.</s>
<s i="17">Ordinarily, such developments would make big corporations easy pickings for plaintiffs' attorneys.</s>
<s i="18">But the scales of justice have tipped, say some lawyers and trial consultants who view the air-bag-defense victories as a byproduct of talk about the desirability of revising tort law.</s>
<s i="19">They argue that huge, seemingly senseless jury awards in cases ranging from breast implants to asbestos to hot <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX>'s coffee have spurred a public backlash.</s>
<s i="20">No longer do juries automatically sympathize with plaintiffs portrayed as helpless victims of heartless corporations.</s>
<s i="21">``Corporate defendants are better off than they were five or 10 years ago,'' says <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Michaele Bierman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">State College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, jury consultant for <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTI Corp.</ENAMEX>, a forensic-technologies firm.</s>
<s i="22">Other legal experts say the trend applies only to the highly touted safety device and play down the auto companies' aggressive strategy.</s>
<s i="23">According to a 2010 study by the <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jury Verdict Research</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRP Publications Inc.</ENAMEX>, auto makers did win air-bag jury verdicts 9% more often than general auto-product liability cases, 21% more often than fuel-system cases and 33% more often than rollover cases.</s>
<s i="24">``It's difficult for a plaintiff to win air-bag cases for good reason: The product is safe and desirable,'' says <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Shirley Joye</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Tort Reform Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="25">Indeed, auto makers say they fight these cases because of their confidence in air bags, not because of juror attitudes.</s>
<s i="26">Improved Tactics Nonetheless, many legal experts say corporations are becoming more savvy in the courtroom, cultivating public sympathy through safety and public-relations campaigns and persuading juries to weigh carefully how much responsibility companies really have for a specific injury.</s>
<s i="27">Until now, many companies tended to settle claims out of court to minimize adverse publicity, hold down legal costs and limit their exposure to potentially huge damage awards.</s>
<s i="28">In a 1992 study, <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Center of State Courts</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">Williamsburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, found that about 75% of the product-liability cases were settled.</s>
<s i="29">Now, some companies are concluding that in the long run, maybe they haven't been saving much money by settling.</s>
<s i="30">Even though <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> has vigorously contested some lawsuits alleging that its <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Bronco</ENAMEX> II sport-utility vehicle rolls over too easily, court documents show that through last year, the company paid more than $113 million in 334 settlements of such cases.</s>
<s i="31">In the 1970s and 1980s, <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> settled hundreds more cases alleging that its cars were unexpectedly slipping from park into reverse, causing injuries and deaths.</s>
<s i="32">But in 2009, <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> says, it adopted a much tougher product-liability stance -- and has saved $100 million in settlement costs.</s>
<s i="33">Last year, it settled 16% fewer cases than in 1993, and it took 5% more to trial.</s>
<s i="34">Cases Analyzed Closely ``We used to be disorganized about product-liability cases in the past, spending a lot of money and hiring outside experts before we even knew the facts,'' says <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta</ENAMEX> Maxima, an in-house product-liability attorney.</s>
<s i="35">Now, <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s in-house lawyers analyze cases within 90 days of filing, deciding whether the plaintiff has a good enough case for <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to settle.</s>
<s i="36">With regard to air bags, auto makers have ample incentive to fight.</s>
<s i="37">After the industry resisted pressure for years from safety advocates and federal regulators to install them, air bags turned out to be immensely popular with increasingly safety-conscious car buyers.</s>
<s i="38">Air bags have saved 1,500 lives, according to <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="39">The bags also reduce by 25% moderate and severe injuries in auto accidents, according to <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="LOCATION">Arlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="40">With air bags installed in about 35 million vehicles in the <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the entire auto industry would suffer if plaintiffs start winning air-bag lawsuits.</s>
<s i="41">``It would open the floodgates for litigation,'' admits <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="42"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Randazzo</ENAMEX>, the wristwatch-and-eyeglasses-case lawyer.</s>
<s i="43">The Basic Problem The problem with air bags is that to protect someone in a serious front-end crash, they are required by law to inflate in a fraction of a second.</s>
<s i="44">When set off by a sensor, air bags -- propelled by potentially hazardous hot gases -- rocket out of a steering wheel or dashboard at about 200 miles an hour -- making them especially dangerous for people not wearing seat belts.</s>
<s i="45">Since 1990, the <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX> says, air bags have killed 42 people, 23 of them children or infants in the front passenger seat.</s>
<s i="46"><ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> safety regulators say that since 2009, about 3,000 people have told the government their air bags had malfunctioned.</s>
<s i="47">Sensing a potential windfall, plaintiffs' lawyers have filed hundreds of suits.</s>
<s i="48">``You have to recognize the bad with the good on air bags,'' says <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormy C.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="49"><ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, plaintiff's attorney.</s>
<s i="50">``So far, the industry isn't willing to admit or focus on the danger areas where there is room for improvement.'' Auto makers complain they are being attacked from all sides.</s>
<s i="51">Most of the early lawsuits complained that the companies, to save money, hadn't installed air bags, and recently courts in some states have upheld the plaintiff's right to bring these cases.</s>
<s i="52">But in many jurisdictions, manufacturers have successfully argued that such suits are precluded by federal regulations that didn't make air bags mandatory until the 2013 model year.</s>
<s i="53">Now, <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> says, the most common suit contends that the bag didn't deploy when it should have.</s>
<s i="54">Other cases contend the bag shouldn't have deployed when it did.</s>
<s i="55">Some plaintiffs say the bags came out too fast; others say they were too slow.</s>
<s i="56">The Decision to Fight The potentially huge wave of litigation convinced <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> it should fight claims like that of <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="57"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Crump</ENAMEX>, whose watch and glasses were broken.</s>
<s i="58">``We decided we can't pay people a couple of hundred dollars every time an air bag goes off.</s>
<s i="59">It would never end,'' says <ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta I.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="60"><ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="PERSON">Dicks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s assistant general counsel in charge of product-liability cases.</s>
<s i="61">The company is putting some of its engineers on the witness stand as much as two months out of the year in <ENAMEX ID="44" TYPE="LOCATION">air</ENAMEX>-bag cases and is prepared to spend more than $100,000 per case.</s>
<s i="62">``We had to make an investment,'' <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="63"><ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="PERSON">Dicks</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="64"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> says it hasn't lost a jury award so far in 200 cases alleging faulty air bags.</s>
<s i="65">Although spokesmen say the company has settled one or two cases, it generally fights them to the <ENAMEX ID="45" TYPE="LOCATION">end.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="66">About 185 of the cases were dropped or dismissed before trial, and juries decided the other 15 in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s favor, it says.</s>
<s i="67"><ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> says it has won 11 out of 12 air-bag jury verdicts and adds that most of its 143 cases over allegedly faulty bags haven't even made it to juries -- 76% were dismissed or dropped.</s>
<s i="68"><ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> settled about 15% of the cases, most for less than $100,000, a spokesman says.</s>
<s i="69"><ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> says it is contesting more than 80% of its air-bag cases but declined to disclose its success rate.</s>
<s i="70">The auto makers' stance hasn't gone unnoticed by plaintiffs' lawyers.</s>
<s i="71">They are asking about air-bag cases less frequently; a database of the <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Trial Lawyers of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> shows inquiries leveling out in 2009 at about 86.</s>
<s i="72">And lawyers specializing in auto litigation say they have turned away dozens of air-bag injury claims.
``air-bag cases are the toughest cases around,'' says <ENAMEX ID="47" TYPE="PERSON">E.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="73"><ENAMEX ID="48" TYPE="PERSON">Tomas Trang</ENAMEX>, a plaintiffs' attorney in <ENAMEX ID="49" TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="75"><ENAMEX ID="51" TYPE="PERSON">Claud</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="52" TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> plaintiffs' attorney, avoids air-bag cases because of the companies' deep pockets and resolve to fight.</s>
<s i="76">``Against the Big Three, you'll go against some tough experts and a great deal of documentation.</s>
<s i="77">That's expensive,'' eyeglasses says.</s>
<s i="78">A Tough <ENAMEX ID="53" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Early Case</ENAMEX> Plaintiffs' attorneys learned early on that most such cases would be tough.</s>
<s i="79">One of the first grew out of a 1991 accident in <ENAMEX ID="54" TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="80"><ENAMEX ID="55" TYPE="LOCATION">Penelope</ENAMEX> M.</s>
<s i="81"><ENAMEX ID="56" TYPE="PERSON">Vern</ENAMEX>, 57, was driving Vern 1986 Ford Tempo -- one of the first <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> cars offering a driver's-side air bag -- when <ENAMEX ID="56" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vern</ENAMEX> sneezed, lost control of the car and hit a utility pole.</s>
<s i="82">The bag deployed.</s>
<s i="83">Though wearing a seat belt and driving about 25 miles an hour, <ENAMEX ID="56" TYPE="PERSON">Vern</ENAMEX> died of internal bleeding caused by a ruptured spleen.</s>
<s i="84">Vern daughter, <ENAMEX ID="57" TYPE="PERSON">Josphine James</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="58" TYPE="LOCATION">Cedar Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="59" TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, sued <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> for $4.4 million, alleging that the air bag caused <ENAMEX ID="56" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vern</ENAMEX> death.</s>
<s i="85">Two years later, a federal jury in <ENAMEX ID="60" TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> ruled for <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, concluding that the bag had functioned properly and attributing Ms.</s>

<s i="92"><ENAMEX ID="65" TYPE="PERSON">Oliver</ENAMEX>, an outside attorney hired by <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, comments, ``We did our homework; we investigated the accident and applied what we knew about air bags.'' <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> says the company called in about three experts and spent at least $100,000 on the case.
eyeglasses believes the verdict signaled jurors' recognition that air bags shouldn't be expected to save everyone in an accident.</s>
<s i="93">``The general issue in these cases,'' says <ENAMEX ID="66" TYPE="PERSON">Edyth</ENAMEX> M.</s>
<s i="94"><ENAMEX ID="67" TYPE="PERSON">Aceves</ENAMEX>, a trial consultant in <ENAMEX ID="68" TYPE="LOCATION">Incline Village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="69" TYPE="LOCATION">Nev.</ENAMEX>, ``is how the jury perceives the company's effort on safety.'' Because jurors are still relatively unfamiliar with air bags, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">eyeglasses</ENAMEX> says, they are more likely to be swayed by testimony from experts for the defense than by plaintiffs' sad stories.</s>
<s i="95">Despite the auto industry's early victories and success in discouraging some lawyers, legal experts and industry officials say suits will be filed at a steady or increasing pace for at least a decade as more cars come equipped with air bags.</s>
<s i="96">Another factor spurring filings is ironic: Because many people expect air bags to make accidents injury-free, just minor injuries create a gap between that expectation and the fact that the 200-mph deployment risks burns, bruises and even serious injuries.</s>
<s i="97">Safety proponents are partly responsible for the excessive hopes; when pushing for introduction of the bags, they made exaggerated claims despite auto makers warnings of possible dangers.</s>
<s i="98"><ENAMEX ID="70" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Much Public Confusion</ENAMEX> ``I think the majority of these cases are based on the perception that air-bag deployment will always cause less injury,'' says <ENAMEX ID="71" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto L.</ENAMEX></s>
