<s i="3">As a teenager, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> was arrested repeatedly for offenses that included selling drugs.</s>
<s i="4">As a young adult, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> addiction to thrills was so great that <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> sometimes received multiple speeding tickets in one night.</s>

<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> is a residential developer here, and <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> is embarking on what may be <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> riskiest move yet: building an $11.9 million, 23,000-square-foot home on speculation -- that is, without a guaranteed buyer.</s>
<s i="7">Many real-estate professionals believe it could be the most expensive speculative home ever built.</s>
<s i="8">``A $12 million spec home?'' asks <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Naples</ENAMEX> real-estate broker <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomas Kenia</ENAMEX> incredulously.</s>

<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano</ENAMEX> believes that there's safety in numbers.</s>
<s i="12">Although exact figures aren't available, developers throughout the state report that luxury spec homes of $1 million and up are becoming more common as builders try to lure a growing crop of young, wealthy home buyers.</s>
<s i="13">These customers want modern conveniences that they can't find in yesterday's mansions, such as those found in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palm Beach</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="14">But they also don't want the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">hassle</ENAMEX> of supervising the construction of a custom home.</s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Naples</ENAMEX> For instance, in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, developer <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isle Worth Real Estate Services Inc.</ENAMEX> is planning to build an $11 million spec home, thought to be the most expensive ever in that area.</s>

<s i="17">One community in Naples will probably have about a dozen multi-million-dollar spec homes in the coming year, about twice the usual rate, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="21"><ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dawne Micheline</ENAMEX> isn't impressed as much by the number of speculative multimillion-dollar homes being built as by the prices being asked for some of the homes.</s>
<s i="22">Until now, the most expensive spec house ever built in the <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> was believed to be a <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palm Beach</ENAMEX> estate that sold for $9 million in the early 1990s.</s>

<s i="27">In January, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> broke ground <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">on La Marceaux</ENAMEX>, a 27-room assembly of soaring towers and slate roofing that will include a nearly life-size replica of the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="28">It's <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Cinderella</ENAMEX>'s castle with a pool.</s>

<s i="43"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano</ENAMEX> was expected to continue the banking tradition.</s>
<s i="44">But <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> never seemed to fit the part.</s>
<s i="45">As a teenager, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> walked away from a promising tennis career and into a series of brushes with the law.</s>
<s i="46">At 14, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.</s>
<s i="47">While in high school, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> was arrested for offenses that included selling drugs.</s>
<s i="48"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> graduated, but barely, with a 1.8 grade-point average.</s>

<s i="51">Not long after graduating from high school, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="52"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Delray Beach</ENAMEX>, a serene town of mostly winter vacationers lodged between <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="53">One of <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> first jobs was to dig sand traps at <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deer Creek</ENAMEX>, a resort in nearby <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">Deerfield Beach</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="54"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> stint at the resort was a short one, and <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="55"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> soon returned to tennis -- this time teaching.</s>
<s i="56">At 19, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> started <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> first company, which created tennis programs for condominium and apartment complexes.</s>
<s i="57">Teaching tennis, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> met countless wealthy entrepreneurs who had done well by investing in real estate.</s>
<s i="58">``My plan was to run them around hard for 45 minutes so they couldn't finish'' their lessons, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> recalls.</s>

<s i="60"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> decided to dabble in real estate himself, using <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> savings and some investors' money to buy distressed residential properties, fix them up and resell them.</s>
<s i="61"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> first house for less than $40,000, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says, and sold it for more than $70,000.</s>
<s i="62">``I paid too much,'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="63">``My margin was only $7,000.'' By 1991, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> was fixing and selling more than a dozen homes a year, all priced under $100,000.</s>

<s i="66">It sold in one year for about $2.2 million, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="67"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="68"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> used the profit on that and previous homes to construct Chateau <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="PERSON">D'Amoureux</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="69">The mansion, although unsold, has become the talk of the town, and, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="70"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says, has had visits from such celebrities as <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Wilmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Kip Tayna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diann Royce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donnetta Sun</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="75">In <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Delray Beach</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> often is described as a self-made man, few people know about <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> family background.</s>
<s i="76"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciano</ENAMEX> Mueller frequently makes the local paper's headlines, most recently for donating to the city the <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Games torch Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> carried during the <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="PERSON">Games torch</ENAMEX> run.</s>

<s i="79">``My wife and I sacrifice a lot to do what we do to be able to carry a house like this for two years,'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says.</s>

<s i="83"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> doesn't own a car, opting to get around on the same motorcycle <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> has driven for seven years.</s>

<s i="91">The prestigious houses of <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palm Beach</ENAMEX> ``are becoming obsolete,'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Mueller</ENAMEX> says, because they don't offer all the conveniences of a new home.</s>
