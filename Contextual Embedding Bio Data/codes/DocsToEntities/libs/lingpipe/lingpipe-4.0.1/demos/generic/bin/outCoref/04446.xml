<s i="1">NEW <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YORK</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Satterwhite</ENAMEX>, former chairman of <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.D.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Satterwhite</ENAMEX>, has been sued by heirs of concentration-camp victims who claim <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Satterwhite</ENAMEX> is in possession of an <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Edison Gabel</ENAMEX> artwork that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vella</ENAMEX> seized from their family during World War II.</s>
<s i="3">The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, is one of the first lawsuits relating to World War II art seizures that has been filed on behalf of one private art collector against another.</s>
<s i="4">Similar disputes among nations have exploded in recent months.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> art treasures in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> were frequently divvied up by troops during World War II and the opening of several formerly Communist countries has spurred a world-wide exchange of data on missing artworks.</s>

<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Satterwhite</ENAMEX>'s attorneys are disputing the charges in the case.</s>
<s i="8">They intend to argue in court that the <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Degas</ENAMEX> Picture may not be the same one that had been owned by the family; that the pastel may have been sold to an art dealer prior to the family's flight from the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Nazis</ENAMEX>; and that the heirs didn't make attempts to reclaim it, even though it has been publicly displayed and published in reference works over the past 53 years.</s>
<s i="9">The lawsuit charges that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Edison Gabel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">``Landscape</ENAMEX> with Smokestacks,'' which Mr.</s>
<s i="10">Satterwhite purchased from an art dealer in 1987 for $850,000, had been sent by <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Fraga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Lourdes Kelm</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> art dealer, <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Paulene Tafoya</ENAMEX>, for safe-keeping in 1939.</s>
<s i="11">The <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Guttmans</ENAMEX> were residing in <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">Holland</ENAMEX> and feared occupation and seizure of their possessions by <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazi</ENAMEX> troops.</s>
<s i="12">In 1943, the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Guttmans</ENAMEX> were captured by the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Gertha South</ENAMEX>, who separated the couple and sent them to concentration camps, where both perished.</s>
<s i="13">The <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> later seized the contents of the dealer's warehouse in <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="14">The <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Guttmans</ENAMEX>' niece and grandchildren brought the lawsuit.</s>
<s i="15">In court, such disputes normally turn on how much the buyer investigated an artwork before purchase and how thoroughly a theft victim searched for the piece.</s>
<s i="16"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Daniele Satterwhite</ENAMEX> was ``a complete good-faith buyer who checked the provenance of the piece well before its purchase,'' said <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Ramon Krauss</ENAMEX>, an attorney for <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="18">Satterwhite with the law firm of <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sidley &amp; Austin</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="19">One of the problems in <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Nazi</ENAMEX> art-seizure disputes is that many art collectors -- convinced that their possessions would be seized because <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Velma</ENAMEX> specifically sought out high-quality artworks -- sold their works before fleeing.</s>
