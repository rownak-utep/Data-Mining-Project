FBI Investigates Mayor Lark..
Reliable sources report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Mayor Lark.
The mayor, we were told, has been implicated with Christopher Quick and Brandi Spann who were previously arrested for their participation in a money laundering scheme here in Vastopolis.
Vastpress is open to any contributing comment from the public relative to this event.
Is this a conspiratorial attack on our mayor?
Or is there evidence to support the basis for FBI activity?
How far does this go?
