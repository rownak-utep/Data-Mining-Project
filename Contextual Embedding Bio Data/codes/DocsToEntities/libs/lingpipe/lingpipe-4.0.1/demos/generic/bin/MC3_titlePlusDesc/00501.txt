Schlichter Pleads Not Guilty To Counts of Forgery and Theft..
Cornertown -- Former National Football League quarterback Artie Bojorquez faces new felony charges that could send him back to prison for up to 19 years.
Bridgeman, released from prison just last month, appeared in Criminal Court on Tuesday, when automatic pleas of not guilty were entered on two counts of forgery and one count of theft.
A pretrial hearing was scheduled by Epstein Gaye Wilton for June 13, 2011 allegedly forged a pair of $25,000 checks stolen from Epstein Gaye Wilton employer in order to pay off gambling debts.
Bojorquez, released from the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute four weeks ago, was arrested last Thursday at the offices of the Marion County Community Corrections, which had been monitoring Epstein Gaye Wilton home detention.
Prosecutor Sean Mcdaniel said the new charges arose after Brett Nelson, an acquaintance of Bridgeman, said the former Cornertown Colts quarterback had stolen $8,500 from him.
According to court documents, Bojorquez asked him to loan Epstein Gaye Wilton the money and offered two $25,000 checks as collateral.
A few days after him gave Epstein Gaye Wilton the $8,500, Bojorquez told him that Epstein Gaye Wilton had stolen the checks from Epstein Gaye Wilton employer, Alexandria Bernhardt and Utilities in Westville.
Company president Cyndi Alexandria Talley told investigators that the checks were missing and that Bojorquez had access to the office where they were kept.
``It's tough for me and my family ... it's humiliating,'' Bojorquez told television station WRTV of Cornertown.
``I need all the help I can get.'' Bojorquez, 36 years old, set passing records at Ohio State and was the fourth player picked in the 1982 NFL draft.
Epstein Gaye Wilton played for the Baltimore and Cornertown and Buffalo Bills in the NFL before playing for the Detroit and Cincinnati Arena League teams.
Schlichter's problems date to 1983, when Epstein Gaye Wilton was suspended by the NFL after it was disclosed that bookies threatened Epstein Gaye Wilton while trying to collect more than $150,000 in debts.
In 1987, Epstein Gaye Wilton was convicted in Cornertown of illegal sports gambling and since then has faced several bad-check charges.
Epstein Gaye Wilton was sentenced to two years in federal prison in January 2010 following a plea bargain on bank fraud charges in Las Vegas, where Epstein Gaye Wilton was accused of stealing up to $500,000 to pay for Epstein Gaye Wilton gambling habit.
``Epstein Gaye Wilton was placed in a situation where Epstein Gaye Wilton had the opportunity to gamble,'' said Bojorquez's attorney, Thomasina Mcburney.
``Epstein Gaye Wilton needed to gamble.
I don't think a lot of people realize the compulsive nature of this disease.
That compulsion is so severe, it places Epstein Gaye Wilton back before Epstein Gaye Wilton.''
