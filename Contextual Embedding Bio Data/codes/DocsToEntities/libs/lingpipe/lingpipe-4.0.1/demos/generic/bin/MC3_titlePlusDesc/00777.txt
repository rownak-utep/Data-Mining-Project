Brown & Williamson Deposes Former Research Chief Wigand..
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. launched the long-awaited deposition of its former research chief Jena Raymer with an assault on Jena Raymer credibility that included questions about two alleged discrepancies in a slim diary.
The deposition marked Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.'s first face-to-face interrogation of Mr.
Jena Raymer about Jena Raymer bombshell allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company.
But it didn't substantially address Mr.
Jena Raymer's key charges: that the company shut down research efforts to make cigarettes safer and its former chairman lied to Congress about the addictiveness of nicotine.
Although the diary entries at issue -- one relating to the date of a meeting and the other referring to the name of a research center -- don't deal with the substance of Mr.
Jena Raymer's allegations, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. contended they prove that Mr.
Jena Raymer fabricated the diary's entire contents sometime after Jena Raymer left the company.
``We have shown Jena Raymer to be a fraud,'' declared Graham Jon, an attorney for B&W, which had set aside a screening room for the press to attend briefings and watch videotapes of the deposition.
``Already, in the first hour, we have taken away any real basis Wigand has for what Jena Raymer said.'' Fraud Contention Disputed A lawyer for Mr..
Jena Raymer, Johnetta Walther, disputed B&W
``It's much ado about nothing,'' Jena Raymer said.
``They haven't laid a glove on Jena Raymer all day.'' The deposition is expected to continue through the rest of the week.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of London-based B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr.
Jena Raymer in November 2010 in a state court in Louisville alleging theft, fraud and breach of Jena Raymer confidentiality agreement -- charges Mr.
Jena Raymer has repeatedly denied.
At a hearing prior to Monday's deposition, a magistrate judge rejected a motion by Mr.
Jena Raymer's lawyers to have Jena Raymer countersuit against B&W dismissed -- a move intended to try to limit the scope of the company's questions about Mr.
Jena Raymer's personal life during the deposition.
During the deposition, Mr.
Jena Raymer denied fabricating Jena Raymer diary and said the diary's references to the research center reflected Jena Raymer own personal shorthand rather than its formal name.
Jena Raymer also said the entry about the meeting was written several weeks after it occurred.
``The date (of the meeting) may not be correct, but the substance is correct,'' Jena Raymer said.
Called Lawyer an `Idiot' In the entry, Mr.
Jena Raymer described a contentious meeting with Kenneth Simpson, a Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. lawyer.
Mr.
Jena Raymer wrote that Mr.
Kenneth Simpson should stop meddling in science and called Jena Raymer an ``idiot.'' Later in the day, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. attacked Mr.
Jena Raymer for failing to correct an assertion made by CBS correspondent Mikki Walter in a segment of the television show, ``60 Minutes,'' that the company had ``cut off'' health-care benefits, needed for one of Jena Raymer children, to intimidate Jena Raymer into signing a more restrictive confidentiality agreement.
Mr.
Johnetta Walther conceded that B&W eventually paid Mr.
Jena Raymer's health-care costs, but alleged that B&W delayed these payments as a scare tactic.
``The idea (B&W) used late payments as an intimidation factor'' is correct, Jena Raymer added.
Mr.
Jena Raymer's deposition began one day after the death of Tomoko Mohammad, who was chief of B&W during Mr.
Jena Raymer's tenure.
Mr.
Tomoko Mohammad died, aged 56, following a long battle with a blood disease.
