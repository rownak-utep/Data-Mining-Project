<s i="1">NEW <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YORK</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to pay $20 million to the state of <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> to settle claims that the firm mishandled the state's investments by engaging in speculative trades that violated state laws.</s>
<s i="2">The <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> case stemmed from one of the largest economic scandals in <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>'s history.</s>
<s i="3">The state's investment fund lost about $280 million in 1986 and 1987, trading bonds, bond options and other fixed-income investments amid a sharp rise in interest rates.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> was one of nine securities firms that helped <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> state officials make high-risk trades for the state's <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Investment Fund.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="5">The <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> trades resulted in losses of about $32 million, state lawyers said.</s>
<s i="6">Wednesday's settlement, reached Monday during mediation in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, caps seven years of litigation between <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> -- one of the last holdouts in the case -- and <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7">Closing the Case The state has already received $28 million in out-of-court settlements from seven securities firms, including <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX>, which paid $15 million, and <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</ENAMEX>, which settled its case for $8.7 million.</s>
<s i="8">In settling the case, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> said it acted properly and settled to avoid further litigation.</s>
<s i="9">``The events in question occurred 10 years ago and it is simply time to close the case and put it fully behind us,'' the firm said in a statement.</s>
<s i="10">The investment bank scored a coup last year when the West <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Supreme Court</ENAMEX> reversed two lower-court decisions that had ordered <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> to reimburse the state for as much as $60 million in investment losses.</s>
<s i="11">But the victory was short-lived because <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> was required to try the case again before the very judge who had ruled three years earlier in favor of the state.</s>
<s i="12">(<ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> tried earlier this year to have the judge recused from the case for alleged bias but failed.) ``For practical reasons, we don't believe it makes sense to return to the original court to litigate the case all over again,'' <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mozell Stefan</ENAMEX> said.</s>
<s i="13">Securities lawyer <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Samara Sean Wilton</ENAMEX>, who wasn't involved in the case, adds: ``I think they won a great decision in the state supreme court but it still had them going to a local judge and I am sure they must have celebrated that with some misgivings.'' The investment bank said the settlement will have no adverse effect on its financial position.</s>
<s i="14">`<ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reasonable</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Leeanna Bynum</ENAMEX>, a lawyer representing the state at <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Wolff Ardis P.C.</ENAMEX>, said the prospect of a second trial drew both sides to the negotiating table.</s>
<s i="15">``It was going to be expensive for both sides,'' <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="16"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Bynum</ENAMEX> said.</s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">She</ENAMEX> called the settlement ``fair and reasonable.'' <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Bynum</ENAMEX> said the state now plans to pursue its case against the securities unit of <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Corp</ENAMEX>.. A spokesman for <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chester</ENAMEX> declined to comment.</s>
<s i="19">Meanwhile, some lawyers say the <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> case could put pressure on <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ENAMEX>, which is being sued by <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Orange County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, to settle claims that it recklessly sold risky investments that led to losses in the county's huge investment pool.</s>
<s i="20">``It may be a bit of downer for <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> because they probably preferred <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> not to pay a cent,'' said one Wall Street securities lawyer.</s>

<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill in YORK</ENAMEX>, said, ``The settlement has no impact on our case and we remain very confident in our legal position.''

<s i="23">The state had stopped doing business with <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> after it sued the investment bank in 1989.</s>
<s i="24">Wednesday, the state's <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Investments</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> as one of the state's broker-dealers, pending completion of the settlement.</s>
