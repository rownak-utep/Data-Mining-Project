<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRENTON</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> -- In an apparent move to throw the first punch in a legal battle, four tobacco companies have sued state Attorney General <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrina Claire</ENAMEX> in an attempt to keep <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> from suing them.</s>
<s i="2">In July, the state named a team of trial lawyers for its yet-to-be-filed lawsuit against the tobacco industry in a move to recover dollars the state says it has spent on tobacco-related illnesses.</s>
<s i="3">The suit asks a <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superior Court</ENAMEX> judge to enter an order blocking <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="5">The tobacco industry has used similar tactics against several of the 15 states that have sued it, said <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Markita Eddins</ENAMEX>, a staff attorney with the Tobacco Products Liability Project in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="6">Copies of the lawsuit were served Friday on the Attorney General's office, the tobacco companies <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean and Williamson Tobacco Corp.</ENAMEX> and its owner, <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorillard Tobacco Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="13">The four tobacco companies said hiring private attorneys is illegal and unethical because it gives the lawyers ``a potentially massive financial stake in the outcome.'' Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Williemae Tull</ENAMEX>.</s>
