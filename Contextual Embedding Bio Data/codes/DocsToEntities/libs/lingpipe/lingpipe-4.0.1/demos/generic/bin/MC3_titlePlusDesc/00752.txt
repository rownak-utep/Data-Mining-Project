Editorial Bad Apples..
Epstein Samara Winford has ruled that Mr.
Ladonna deserves a new trial.
The grounds for his decision are technical.
The judge said that his incorrectly omitted the word ``alone'' from the following jury instruction: ``Evidence of the defendant's honesty, truthfulness and veracity and law-abidingness alone may create a reasonable doubt whether the government proved that the defendant committed the crime.'' In fact, defense lawyers presented ample evidence that during his 73 years Mr.
Ladonna has led an exemplary and blameless life, which would support his contention that the errors his committed were inadvertent.
But the judge's opinion actually casts further doubt on the government prosecution.
After the case concluded, Mr.
Ladonna's family hired a private eye to talk with Jefferson Mose, the government's main witness.
Mr.
Mose, a disgruntled former employee, was given a walk on the charges in the case in return for testifying that Mr.
Ladonna had told Mr. to falsify pollution tests.
This is what convinced the jury that Mr.
Ladonna was a bad guy.
But in tape-recorded conversations with the gumshoe, Mr.
Mose contradicted Mr. courtroom testimony.
For instance, during the trial Mr. testified that Mr.
Ladonna had told Mr. to move a decimal point on one test result; in the tape-recording Mr..
Mose said, ``Mr. never told me to do that.'' Epstein Samara Winford wrote that ``the court's confidence in the outcome of this trial has been undermined by Jefferson Mose's post trial statements.'' The judge did not cite this as grounds for a new trial, but Mr. did indicate that defense lawyers could use this evidence to impeach Mr.
Jefferson Mose's testimony in the future.
The question is whether there'll be another trial.
Will the government, beaten once, decide to again prosecute this World War II veteran and Sunday school teacher on what Mr. rightly calls ``these foolish charges''?
That decision will be up to the Justice Department, and specifically Lola Seymour, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Environmental and Natural Resources Division.
If the prosecutors possess even a shred of decency, they will cut their losses and stop the persecution of Benedict Ladawn.
Mr.'s already suffered plenty.
``It's been quite an ordeal and quite an expense,'' Mr. told us, ``and I don't know any way to gain it back.''
