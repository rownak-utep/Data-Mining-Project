I.S.G., Some Directors, Sued For $1.5 Million by Ex-Chief..
TORONTO -- The deposed president and chief executive officer of I.S.G.
Technologies Inc. has sued the company and several of its directors for 2.1 million Canadian dollars (US$1.5 million), alleging breach of contract.
I.S.G. said the lawsuit, filed by Thomasina Koger in the Ontario Court of Justice, was without merit.
Gertie Crysta, I.S.G.'s chief financial officer, said the company expects to live up to the terms of the employment contract by providing Mr.
Thomasina Koger with a severance package; Thomasina Koger declined to give details.
Mr.
Thomasina Koger, who joined I.S.G. in November from Siemens AG, was fired after presenting the board with a three-year strategic plan that diverged from I.S.G.'s past direction of designing under contract visualization software for medical imaging, Mr.
Gertie Crysta said.
Michaele Bruner, I.S.G.'s chairman, assumed the added role of chief executive officer.
The company is seeking a candidate for the posts of president and chief operating officer.
In Thomasina Koger lawsuit, Mr.
Thomasina Koger, who also was a director, is seeking C$750,000 from I.S.G., and C$750,000 from five of its nine directors.
Thomasina Koger also is seeking C$500,000 in ``aggravated damages'' and C$100,000 in punitive damages.
Three other board members opposed Thomasina Koger dismissal.
