Citron Testifies Merrill Salesman Knew of Interest-Skimming Plan..
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A Merrill Lynch & Co. salesman knew that funds were secretly diverted from schools, cities and agencies into Orange County coffers, former county Treasurer Roberto L.
Bonnell told a jury.
Mr.
Bonnell, who has pleaded guilty to six felonies related to the scheme, also said it was Bonnell assistant Maud Logan's idea to skim other people's interest into a county-controlled account.
In December 2009, after Mr.
Bonnell's risky investments lost $1.6 billion, the county filed the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy.
But in early 1993, when the diversions began, Bonnell returns were huge.
Bonnell said Bonnell was proud of that, but Mr.
Maud Logan worried the yields were so high they would spook investors.
``Mr.
Maud Logan came to me and said ... the pool investors would see something wrong in that and pull their money out,'' Mr.
Bonnell testified.
Bonnell said Bonnell agreed to transfer some money from the treasury's pool of commingled funds to the county general fund.
Assistant Orange County District Attorney Janae Norberto asked if the 200 noncounty pool participants had consented to the plan.
``They were not informed,'' Mr.
Bonnell said.
Bonnell added that Bonnell knew the money did not belong to the general fund and did not object to Mr.
Janae Norberto's repeated characterization of it as ``stolen.'' Mr.
Bonnell, cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a light sentence, testified at the trial of former county Budget Director Roni S.
Roseberry on two counts of aiding and abetting the illegal scheme.
Bonnell said Mr.
Roseberry was jubilant to learn that the county budget, impoverished by recession and state budget cuts, would have new funds.
Mr.
Roseberry set up the Economic Uncertainty Fund into which the skimmed interest was funneled, and decided to let the county supervisors touch only the interest the funds earned, not the principal, Mr.
Bonnell testified.
But Bonnell said Bonnell never disclosed to Mr.
Roseberry the fact that interest was being underreported to schools, cities and agencies.
And Bonnell said as far as Bonnell knew, Mr.
Maud Logan had never revealed the scheme to Mr.
Roseberry either.
Mr.
Bonnell said Bonnell only told one other person: Michaele Palmira, a Merrill Lynch salesman with whom Bonnell spoke every day and who had sold the county the bulk of the interest-rate-sensitive securities that ultimately brought down the treasury.
Mr.
Bonnell said that Bonnell had great respect for Merrill Lynch's financial advice and, using it, became convinced that Bonnell had ``perfected'' the use of high-risk borrowing techniques so the county couldn't lose money.
In a statement, Merrill Lynch said Mr.
Michaele Palmira never was involved in any internal allocation of funds at the county and denied Bonnell was aware that too little interest was paid to the noncounty investors in the treasury.
Merrill Lynch, denying any wrongdoing in the case, is battling a $2 billion civil suit in which the county contends it must share the blame for the investment losses.
Mr.
Bonnell's lawyer, Davina W.
Ludlow, has said in court previously that psychological tests show marked mental deterioration in Bonnell client, and has suggested that greedy Merrill Lynch and county officials exploited Mr.
Bonnell's enfeebled state.
Mr.
Bonnell showed few signs of mental weakness, however.
A stutterer all Bonnell life, Bonnell stammered and hesitated slightly on some occasions.
But Bonnell seemed generally composed and better able to express himself than at a state Senate hearing in early 2010, when Bonnell often seemed flustered or gave rambling answers.
Mr.
Bonnell's refusal to implicate Mr.
Roseberry directly in wrongdoing follows a series of rulings that have hampered the prosecution.
The most severe is Superior Court Headley Stephine Amaro's ruling that Mr.
Maud Logan's grand jury testimony is inadmissible.
Mr.
Maud Logan told the secret panel that the interest diversions were Mr.
Roseberry's idea, jointly developed by Messrs.
Roseberry and Citron.
However, Mr.
Maud Logan will refuse to testify against Mr.
Roseberry on grounds Bonnell might incriminate himself, and Epstein Amaro wouldn't allow the grand jury testimony in evidence unless Mr..
Maud Logan could be cross-examined effectively by the defense.
The testimony also gave Epstein Amaro, who is to sentence Mr.
Bonnell, a chance to evaluate the former treasurer's sincerity and state of mind.
Epstein Amaro Amaro scheduled a status conference in the Citron. case for May 23, 2011 said Bonnell will set a sentencing date for Mr.
Bonnell at that time.
Mr.
Bonnell theoretically could be sentenced to as much as 14 years.
But a probation officer evaluating Bonnell case has recommended Bonnell be sentenced to no more than a year in the county jail.
Bonnell is hoping to be sentenced to probation and community service.
