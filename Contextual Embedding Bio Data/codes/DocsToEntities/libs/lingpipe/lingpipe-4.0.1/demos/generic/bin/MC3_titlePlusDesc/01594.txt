Vehicle Downtown Checked for Bomb Threat..
Local merchants called police following suspicions of a truck with out-of-state license plates parked near them for several days.
The truck was spray-painted with graffiti with one tire flat.
There were 4 black 50 gallon barrels observed inside the vehicle.
As a precaution, the police bomb squad was dispatched to verify the contents of the cargo.
Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio said that this was merely a police procedure without elaborating the need for the bomb squad in the first place.
Since the Commissioner denied any findings, the truck was taken away by the city.
