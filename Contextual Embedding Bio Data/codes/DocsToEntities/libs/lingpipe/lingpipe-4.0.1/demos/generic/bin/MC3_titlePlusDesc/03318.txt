Susan McDougal Receives Prison Sentence of 2 Years..
Susana Mccool, a former partner of Billie and Hilma Codi in the Whitewater real estate development, received a two-year prison sentence for savings-and-loan fraud.
Ms.
Mccool argued that she deserved a lenient sentence because she was following instructions of she then-husband Jamey Mccool, owner of the defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.
Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. rejected Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. explanation, although Jamey Mccool could have sentenced Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. to up to 17 years.
Jamey Mccool, convicted of 18 fraud and conspiracy counts, won't be sentenced until July 31, 2011 Jamey Mccool is cooperating with the probe of Whitewater independent counsel  .
Bobbye Mendez, Ms.
Jamey Mccool's attorney, said Jamey Mccool client was being ``used as a political pawn'' by Mr.
Stasia in order to build a case against President Hilma Codi.
Mr.
Stasia told reporters outside the Courthouse, Downtown that Jamey Mccool would still welcome Ms.
Susana Mccool's cooperation and implied that Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. may be able to reduce Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. sentence.
