<s i="1">INDIANAPOLIS -- A state-court jury sided with the tobacco industry in a closely watched case, refusing to award damages to the family of a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer at age 52.</s>
<s i="2">But in a postverdict news conference here, the six-member jury minimized the industry's victory.</s>
<s i="3">The jurors disclosed that they believed cigarette makers had been negligent in the case and that under somewhat different circumstances, they would have ruled for the plaintiff.</s>
<s i="4">ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">the U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7">Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Codi</ENAMEX>'s crackdown on tobacco advertising.</s>
<s i="8">The verdict let the $45 billion tobacco industry avoid a potentially significant blow, amid a mounting wave of legal setbacks.</s>
<s i="9">It came just two weeks after a <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> jury awarded an ex-smoker and <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Award</ENAMEX> Damages wife $750,000, the steepest damages ever in a cigarette-liability case, sending tobacco stocks sharply lower.</s>
<s i="10">The shares traded heavily last week as investors awaiting the <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> verdict worried about the liability exposure of an industry that hasn't yet paid a penny in damages.</s>
<s i="11">But the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> verdict doesn't mean that the cigarette makers are out of the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">woods.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12">The jury never saw a pile of new internal industry documents about <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nicotine</ENAMEX>, addiction and cancer that had heavily influenced the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> jury.</s>
<s i="13">And an <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> state law gave the jury a higher standard than several states require for a plaintiff's verdict.</s>
<s i="14">In a prepared statement read by foreman <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Andrea</ENAMEX> in a packed courtroom, the jury expressed ``concern that our verdict may be misconstrued as an endorsement of the tobacco companies' position on smoking and health.'' The statement declared: ``In this case, under the laws of <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>, we found (the plaintiff) <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Ricki</ENAMEX> Refugio bore a greater responsibility for the condition that caused <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> death than did the actions of the defendants.'' It added: ``However, we felt the evidence did show a degree of negligence on the part of the cigarette companies.'' To what extent, Mr.</s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Andrea</ENAMEX> said, the jury couldn't agree, except that the industry's negligence didn't exceed 50%.</s>
<s i="16">Under <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>'s law of comparative fault, that finding alone required a verdict for the defense on the claim that cigarettes were negligently designed, manufactured and sold.</s>
<s i="17">The jurors also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous because they addict smokers and cause lung cancer.</s>
<s i="18">For the tobacco industry, the verdict -- announced late Friday -- offered a psychological boost on the same day that President <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> declared <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nicotine</ENAMEX> an addictive drug by announcing sweeping federal restrictions to curb tobacco advertising to children.</s>
<s i="19">Earlier in the week, three states joined the list of 10 that already had filed suit to recoup the public health-care cost of treating smoking-related <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">ailments.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="20">The four tobacco-company defendants instantly seized on the verdict as a sign that the landmark <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> verdict was just an <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aberration</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="21">``This unanimous verdict sends a clear signal that there is no legal groundswell in the American court system to reverse 40 years of precedents that people are responsible for their own actions when it comes to tobacco use,'' said <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Charlette R.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Melton</ENAMEX>, senior vice president for litigation at <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Philip Morris Cos</ENAMEX>..</s>
<s i="23">Some industry analysts, however, were not so quick to agree, noting that the plaintiffs' lawyer who won the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> verdict has some 200 other cases pending in that state, including three slated for later this year.</s>
<s i="24">And <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> is one of 13 states that lets a jury return damages if a defendant is as little as 1% negligent.</s>
<s i="25">``We're just going to have to see whether the industry can put on the same sort of defense in these <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> cases,'' said <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">Diann Tenesha</ENAMEX>, a tobacco analyst at <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Cornertown</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="26">Antismoking activists went further, saying the verdict wasn't a good indicator of future results since <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion County Superior Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta H.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="27"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Jona</ENAMEX> limited plaintiffs' evidence to what was admitted when the case first went to trial last year.</s>
<s i="28">That case ended with a hung jury.</s>
<s i="29">``What's remarkable is that even lacking that evidence, this jury expressed serious misgivings about letting the tobacco industry off the hook,'' said <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Maud Hamilton</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">Vastopolis</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="32">By high school, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Award Damages</ENAMEX> was smoking two packs a day, and by law school, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Award Damages</ENAMEX> was up to three.</s>

<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willy</ENAMEX>, took pains to show the jury how ingrained in the public mind the health risks of smoking were long before <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="40">As in the prior trial, much of the testimony centered on defining addiction.</s>

<s i="42"><ENAMEX ID="45" TYPE="PERSON">Douglass</ENAMEX>, unable to present the industry's own documents on the subject that proved so influential to the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> jury, relied on testimony from two experts, Dr. <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="PERSON">Davina M.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="43">Grady, a senior scientific expert for the 1988 Surgeon <ENAMEX ID="47" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>'s Report, and Dr. <ENAMEX ID="48" TYPE="PERSON">Stephine Jayme</ENAMEX>, assistant dean of the <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="49" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Medical School</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="44">Both testified that an addiction is a physiological, chemical dependence that cigarette manufacturers have long recognized as extremely difficult to quit.</s>
<s i="45">Just how difficult?</s>

<s i="47"><ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="PERSON">Refugio</ENAMEX> described trying to quit several times by tossing out Award Damages cigarettes on Friday nights and lying in bed in a cold sweat, curled in a fetal position until Monday morning, when <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Award</ENAMEX> Damages would buy a fresh pack first thing on the way to work.</s>
<s i="48">But the jury said it found that testimony unconvincing.</s>

<s i="53">Refugio replied in a deposition before Award Damages death, ``I didn't really want to quit.'' The jury, which deliberated 18 1/2 hours over two days, said it was struck most by this lack of evidence that <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="54">Refugio ever seriously tried to quit smoking, and thereby incurred <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Award</ENAMEX> Damages own risk.</s>
