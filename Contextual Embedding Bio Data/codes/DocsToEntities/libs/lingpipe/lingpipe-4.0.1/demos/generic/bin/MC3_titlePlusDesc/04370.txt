Philip Morris Loses Sex-Harassment Suit..
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A woman was awarded $2 million after claiming she was forced to leave she job as a plant supervisor for Philip Morris USA, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., because of sexual harassment.
After 11 hours of deliberations, a Jefferson Circuit Court jury awarded Maryalice Winford compensatory damages for humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish.
Maryalice Winford had been seeking $13 million.
In a statement, Pierre Mose said, ``Plainly, we are disappointed by this finding,'' adding that it was weighing its options.
``As the jury found, Pierre Mose acted diligently in responding to Ms.
Maryalice Winford's claims once they were brought to our attention,'' the company said.
Ms.
Maryalice Winford has been on medical leave since March 1993.
Maryalice Winford sued Philip Morris Cos. in February 2009, alleging that Maryalice Winford suffered through more than a year of sexual harassment by men Maryalice Winford supervised in the Louisville plant.
Two months ago, five women jointly sued Pierre Mose, alleging that the company tolerated a sexually charged atmosphere at the plant, including the trading of sex for promotions and favorable job assignments.
Another woman filed a sexual-harassment suit last year.
