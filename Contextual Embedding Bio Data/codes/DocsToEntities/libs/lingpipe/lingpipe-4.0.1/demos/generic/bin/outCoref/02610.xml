<s i="1">A state-court judge in <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> has ruled that an in-house lawyer at <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont Co.</ENAMEX> and an outside law firm made fraudulent representations involving sensitive test data sought by ornamental plant growers who were suing the company over its Benlate <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> fungicide.</s>
<s i="2">The decision, by <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> Roni <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Covington</ENAMEX>, marks the fourth time in the past year and a half that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> has been reprimanded by a judge for withholding evidence in litigation over <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX>
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed alleging that the fungicide, which was discontinued in 1991, caused millions of dollars in plant and crop damage nationwide.</s>
<s i="3">Last year, a federal judge in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> fined the company $115 million for withholding the same test data in a separate case.</s>
<s i="4">The company is appealing.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> also reprimanded and fined <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> last year for withholding the test data, but <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> latest ruling is the first to single out a <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> official by name.</s>
<s i="6">The judge said <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Georgeanna Fransisca</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>'s in-house lawyer in charge of coordinating its responses to pretrial fact-finding demands by plaintiffs, testified at a hearing in the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> case in July 1993 that <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blunt</ENAMEX> had no ``ongoing'' testing involving <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> and that the company had turned over all records requested by plaintiffs.</s>
<s i="7">In fact, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> soil tests had just been completed for <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> by an independent consulting firm, <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alta Analytical Laboratories</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">El Dorado Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, on the day Mr.</s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgeanna Fransisca</ENAMEX> testified.</s>
<s i="9">A summary of the results, which were favorable to <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>, was relayed to plaintiffs in the separate Benlate <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> case in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">Vern Ely</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="10">But the underlying data, including initial readings of some soil samples that plaintiffs contend undermine the reliability of the final results, were withheld, both in the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> case and in <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="11">`Convincing <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Evidence</ENAMEX>' The judge found <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgeanna Fransisca</ENAMEX>'s testimony, both that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> had no ongoing tests and that it had turned over all relevant records requested by the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> plaintiffs, ``fraudulent by clear and convincing evidence.'' Mr. also rebuked the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, firm <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell &amp; Moring, DuPont</ENAMEX>'s national counsel in charge of its Benlate DF defense.</s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell &amp; Moring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>, the judge ruled, misled plaintiffs in <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> by claiming in court filings that the Alta test data were attorney work product, and thus off-limits, without disclosing that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> had waived that argument at the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> Ranch trial when it introduced a summary of the Alta tests.</s>
<s i="14">In <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s> <s i="15">60-page opinion, entered two weeks ago, the judge concluded that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> engaged in ``abusive litigation practices,'' ``bad faith,'' <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">``fraud</ENAMEX>'' and ``intentional misconduct.'' <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont Lawyer</ENAMEX> DuPont characterized the opinion as ``judicial piling on'' because the ruling mirrors a similar finding of fraud last year by the judge in the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vern Ely</ENAMEX> case.</s>
<s i="16">The <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, chemical giant defended <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgeanna Fransisca</ENAMEX>, saying Mr. testimony that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> had no ``ongoing'' tests was limited to testing by the company, not its outside consultants.</s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> also took issue with <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX>'s finding that <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> committed fraud by repeatedly asserting an attorney privilege in <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">Mr.</ENAMEX> court after having already waived it in the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Vern</ENAMEX> Ely case.</s>
<s i="19">``<ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> is simply wrong in <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr.</ENAMEX> ruling,'' a spokesman for <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blunt</ENAMEX> said in a statement, ``and we are appealing.</s>
<s i="20">We are confident that that ruling is going to be set aside.'' <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="21"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgeanna Fransisca</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.</s>
<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell &amp; Moring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> declined to comment.</s>
<s i="23">The issue of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>'s handling of the Alta test results first surfaced in late 2009, during the seven-month trial in the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> case before <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="24">Plaintiffs' lawyers demanded the complete Alta test results, not just the summary data presented in <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">Vern Ely</ENAMEX> case.</s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> fought unsuccessfully to the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to keep from turning over the test data, citing the attorney work-product privilege.</s>
<s i="26">Decision Is Appealed <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> eventually fined <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> $1.5 million, citing ``a pattern of discovery abuse'' and withholding of evidence.</s>
<s i="27">Both that order and the jury's $23.9 million damage award to plaintiffs in that case are being appealed.</s>
<s i="28">But <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> decided to revisit Mr. ruling after <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epstein J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roberto Elly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> fined <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> last year.</s>
<s i="30">The company had argued in a weeklong hearing in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> that the records were available during the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> Ranch trial but that the plaintiffs never asked for them.</s>
<s i="31">That argument piqued <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> Epstein <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Roni Covington</ENAMEX>'s interest because <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> had told Mr. that the Alta data had ``never been produced, proffered or in any way used in connection with any other <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benlate trial.</ENAMEX>'' In Mr. latest opinion, <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Roni Covington</ENAMEX> reaffirmed Mr. earlier fine and amended several of Mr. past orders to reflect how Mr. would have ruled at the time had Mr. known more about <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>'s conduct.</s>
<s i="32">The judge said <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> would have ordered a plaintiff's verdict by default, leaving damages as the only issue for the jury to decide, and would have levied ``substantially more severe monetary sanctions.'' Mr. amended order will now become a part of the trial record that the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will review on appeal.</s>
<s i="33">Reprimanded in <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> DuPont was reprimanded again in June after a state judge in <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> heard evidence that the company destroyed results of <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DF</ENAMEX> tests on plants in <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX>, mislabeled documents and produced illegible records.</s>
<s i="34">As a sanction, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> fined <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> $20,000 and ordered a plaintiff's victory in the case by default.</s>
<s i="35">``<ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> and its lawyers have participated and continue to participate in utter disregard for orders of the court, and for the rules of evidence and ethics...,'' <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dade County Circuit Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="PERSON">Amy Steele Donner</ENAMEX> ruled from the bench.</s>
<s i="36">``This is a pattern, it is willful, it is deliberate and it is intended to thwart the orders of this court.'' A <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company ``disagreed fully'' with the ruling and denied that it conducted any field tests in <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX>, secret or otherwise, and concealed the evidence.</s>
<s i="37">The company said it was never given a chance to present <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> Derosier with its side of the story.</s>
<s i="38"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX>'s final ruling, entered in August, was vacated several days later because <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX> settled the case out of court.</s>
<s i="39">All copies were ordered sealed and destroyed at the lawyers' request.</s>
