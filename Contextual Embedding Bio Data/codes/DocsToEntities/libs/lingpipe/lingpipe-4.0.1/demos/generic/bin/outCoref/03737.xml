-- Cadillac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey</ENAMEX>, the luxury standard bearers, are suddenly in a price war.</s>
<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> division and <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> unit have resorted to steep price cuts on most of their models in an attempt to fight growing competition from sport-utility vehicles, European sedans and more luxurious minivans.</s>
<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> on Friday posted the latest cuts, a direct response to reductions announced only days earlier by <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="3">The <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> move amounted to a rollback of 1997-model prices it announced March 09, 2011 the moves reflect problems with both brands, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> executives quickly took credit for starting the price war between the long-running rivals, calling it a response to consumers' broader definition of what a luxury automobile is today.</s>
<s i="4">``We understand what <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has done, and it was not unanticipated,'' said <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Jaime Perrault</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s group vice president for world-wide product development.</s>
<s i="5">``This represents a sea change in the luxury car market... .</s>
<s i="6">The driving force is competition.'' Luxury Pickups Clearly, in recent years more vehicle buyers have been satisfying their cravings for luxury by purchasing leather-seated pickup trucks and minivans and well-equipped family sedans as more <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX>-like features have made their way onto not-quite-luxury vehicles.</s>
<s i="7">Also, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> sales have been hurt by a resurgence in demand for <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">German</ENAMEX>-built luxury sedans by <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benz AG</ENAMEX> unit.</s>
<s i="8">Through July, sales of <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> cars were up 10.8% from a year before, while <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Lincolns</ENAMEX> were off 19.6% and <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillacs</ENAMEX> were up just 4.3%.</s>
<s i="9">Meanwhile, sales of <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>'s $30,000-plus minivan, the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UpUptown &amp; Country</ENAMEX>, jumped 169% as the van received a big boost from a makeover aimed at luxury-car buyers.</s>
<s i="10">Still, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> executives played down their decision to cut prices, maintaining that it wasn't a response to <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey</ENAMEX>'s move.</s>
<s i="11">Instead, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> is cutting sticker prices to match more closely the prices consumers actually negotiate.</s>
<s i="12">This fits in with <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s broader ``value-pricing'' initiative, which generally is intended to offer a complete package of options for a competitive price requiring less haggling between customers and salespeople.</s>
<s i="13">The war between <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> and is producing some fairly dramatic reductions.</s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX>'s 1997-model <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="LOCATION">Seville SLS</ENAMEX>, for example, will sell with a base price of $39,995 -- 9.1% less than the $43,995 <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> had originally set.</s>
<s i="15">Its direct Lindsay competitor, the <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX>, will sell for $37,950, 11.9% less than the final 2011 base price.</s>
<s i="16">Fewer Promotions Likely Industry experts doubt the price cuts will sharply boost sales of either brand, but they are likely to make <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Lindsay</ENAMEX> less dependent on costly promotions, such as cash rebates and discounted lease deals.</s>
<s i="17">Last year, sales-incentive costs on the <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> averaged $4,000 a car, according to industry executives familiar with <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s marketing practices.</s>
<s i="18">``That allows people who previously could not buy those cars to get into them, and that dilutes a brand's image,'' observes <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Whitley Dean</ENAMEX>, an industry consultant with <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSM</ENAMEX> Forecasting in <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Mich..</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> and do have other plans in mind to boost sales: In October, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Cadillac</ENAMEX> will introduce <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="LOCATION">thean</ENAMEX> entry-level luxury car that <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has priced with a base sticker of $29,995, a price point targeted at younger buyers.</s>
<s i="20">Likewise, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is hoping Lindsay can cash in on the sport-utility vehicle craze with its full-size entry, the yet-to-be-priced <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigator</ENAMEX>, which will make its debut next year.</s>
<s i="21">Separately, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> announced 2012 prices for its redesigned Dodge <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Dakota</ENAMEX> small pickup trucks.</s>
<s i="22">It said the truck will have fewer model variations but more features on those that remain.</s>
<s i="23">For example, the new base, two-wheel-drive regular-cab with a short wheelbase has a starting price of $13,235.</s>
<s i="24">That is 14.3% higher than the the previous 2011 base model.</s>
<s i="25">The 2012 base model has new standard equipment, however, such as dual air bags, a four-speaker stereo system, larger tires and cargo tie-down hooks.</s>
