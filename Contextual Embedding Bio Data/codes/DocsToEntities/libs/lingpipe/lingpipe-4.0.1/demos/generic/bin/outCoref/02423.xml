<s i="1">Attorneys for a former <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</ENAMEX> executive vowed to appeal a <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> judge's order Thursday to extradite the man to <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">His</ENAMEX> faces bribery charges.</s>
<s i="2">The appeal will most likely push the extradition battle beyond the British colony's March 12, 2012 handover to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, complicating the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s government's efforts to secure the former executive's return.</s>
<s i="3">Currently, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is covered by an extradition treaty between the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="16"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Jesica Lingerfelt</ENAMEX> is charged with accepting $4.5 million in bribes from a <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> company in return for a steady supply of top-brand cigarettes made by <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</ENAMEX>'s parent, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T..</ENAMEX></s>
