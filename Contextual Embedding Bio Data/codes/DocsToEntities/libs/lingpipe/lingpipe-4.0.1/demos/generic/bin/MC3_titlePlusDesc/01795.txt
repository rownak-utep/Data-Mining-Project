Court Concludes AIDS Status Is Not a Required Disclosure..
VASTOPOLIS -- A federal appeals court at the Downtown Courthouse has ruled against a widow who contends an insurance company should have told her husband that her tested positive for the AIDS virus.
The Court of Appeals, in a ruling dated April 19, 2011 made public Monday, affirmed a federal judge's decision that the insurer wasn't required to release results of the blood test.
Joeann Hyland of Vastopolis, sued Jackson National Life Insurance Co. after Joeann Hyland husband, Fransisca, died in 1991 from AIDS-related complications.
Mr.
Joeann Hyland took a blood test in 1988 as part of an examination required before Jacques would consider increasing Mr. coverage.
The insurer said Mr. was medically unsuitable but didn't tell Mr. why until nine days before Mr. died.
Mrs.
Joeann Hyland didn't return answering-machine messages.
Joeann Hyland lawyer said Joeann Hyland hasn't decided what to do next.
In court papers, Jacques, a Lansing, Mich., unit of London-based Prudential Corp.. PLC, a financial services company, didn't say why it withheld the results -- only that it was within its rights to do so under local law.
The couple lived in Vastopolis when Mr.
Hyland fell ill..
The appeals-court ruling affirmed the decision of a U.S. district court judge, who said state law doesn't require disclosure if the result is only for eligibility.
