<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?><output><s i="0">Despite Its <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>, the 747 <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Is Still Airlines</ENAMEX>' Most Popular <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plane</ENAMEX>..</s>
<s i="1">It may be one of the oldest passenger jets still flying, but the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 is still widely popular among business travelers -- and many other fliers looking for space and comfort.</s>
<s i="2">The jet, with its distinctive hump over the front cabin, has been flying commercially for 26 years, dating back to the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Ricki Trujillo</ENAMEX> years.</s>
<s i="3">But while aircraft age bothers many fliers, it hasn't kept them away from this particular jet.</s>
<s i="4">In fact, travel managers and agents say the popularity of the 747 has grown over the years and still will despite the <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctica Airlines</ENAMEX> disaster.</s>
<s i="5">That's because airlines keep installing smaller and less comfortable jets on long-distance flights.</s>
<s i="6">The 747's business-class cabin, for example, has up to twice as many seats as most other long-distance jets and a cabin that is both wider and longer.</s>
<s i="7">``Frequent fliers like to grumble all the time, but this is one plane you don't hear too many complaints about,'' says <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Edelmira Spencer</ENAMEX> of Consumer Reports <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travel Letter</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="8">``It's just viewed as more spacious.'' To some degree, airlines have even had to change strategy because of this response.</s>
<s i="9">Originally, the 747 was going to be retired around 1990, as the newer models replaced it.</s>
<s i="10">Instead, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> has 30 747s on order, and <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> is still flying about 50 of them.</s>
<s i="11">``People tell us they like the jet,'' says a <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> spokeswoman.</s>
<s i="12">``That's something we just can't ignore.'' Since its first commercial flight on October 02, 2010 the 747 has always been held a little bit in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">awe</ENAMEX> by aviation experts and travelers.</s>
<s i="13">At 230 feet in length, it is still the largest aircraft in the world.</s>
<s i="14">It has four engines, as many as 500 seats in some configurations and even a second floor.</s>
<s i="15">During the industry's glory years of the 70s, the jet was a symbol of luxury airline service, with some carriers opting to put first-class lounges or sleeper seats on the upper <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">tier.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="16">But the plane slowly lost its appeal in the 1980s, as airline deregulation and cheap air fares forced the industry to develop less expensive models.</s>
<s i="17">Today, the newer long-haul jets burn about one-tenth as much fuel and require fewer crew members, making them thousands of dollars cheaper to operate on each flight.</s>
<s i="18">Economically, there's no comparison, says <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Mendiola</ENAMEX>, an official at <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avmark Inc.</ENAMEX>, an aviation consultant in <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">Arlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Va..</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19">This is how you have $25 fares.</s>
<s i="20">But travelers say there's a noticeable difference in the flying experience between the new and old, especially on transcontinental service.</s>
<s i="21">On these routes, many <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines now fly a narrow-body jet, the 757, that is 80 feet shorter and eight feet narrower than the 747 and which has only one aisle instead of two.</s>
<s i="22">Internationally, the 747 is still about 30 feet longer than the most widely used newer models, and about six feet wider in the cabin, which many travelers say they notice over the course of a long trip.</s>
<s i="23">The 747 is ``definitely my plane of choice,'' says <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sung Elly</ENAMEX>, a business flier for <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Bean Bran Co.</ENAMEX> ``It's easier to get up and walk around, and they don't pile the people in as much.'' <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> flies the aircraft between <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> whenever <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> can.</s>
<s i="24">``It seems like the 747 has more leg room,'' <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> adds.</s>
<s i="25">Some companies also report a preference among employees, too, including <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Starch &amp; Chemical</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Bridgewater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="26">``The largeness of the plane makes people more relaxed,'' says <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Tommie Bart</ENAMEX>, the company's corporate travel manager.</s>
<s i="27">Our people tend to be more comfortable in the longer, wider aircraft.</s>
<s i="28">The jet is also popular because, with its extra length, its business-class sections have anywhere from 50 to 70 seats.</s>
<s i="29">The 757 jet has only 20 business-class or first-class seats.</s>
<s i="30">And the size of this cabin is crucial, what with air travel booming and business fliers having trouble even getting a seat, either by paying higher fares or using their frequent-flier miles.</s>
<s i="31">On a growing number of international flights, many carriers are simply sold out in business class on their smaller jets.</s>
<s i="32">``That's definitely a major concern for the frequent flier, just getting out of coach,'' says <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="33">Spencer of Consumer Reports.</s>
<s i="34">Despite its age, most safety experts say the 747 has a fairly strong safety record.</s>
<s i="35">According to federal figures, it has averaged slightly less than one fatal accident for every 1 million departures.</s>
<s i="36">That's about half the fatal accident rate of all other commercial airliners combined.</s>
<s i="37">Some of the 747's most highly publicized accidents haven't been related to mechanical problems either but instead have been the result of terrorism or pilot error.</s>
<s i="38">But because it flies so many passengers, most fatal accidents involving the 747 have enormous death tolls.</s>
<s i="39">Five of the world's 10 worst commercial aviation disasters, in fact, have involved 747s, including the 1988 bombing of a <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> jet over <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, that killed 103 people.</s>
<s i="40">Korean <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Lines</ENAMEX>' Flight 007, which was shot down in 1983 near <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, killing all 269 people aboard, also was a 747.</s>
<s i="41">And in 1985, the rupture of a pressure wall caused a <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Lines</ENAMEX> 747 to crash, killing 520 people in history's worst single-plane disaster.</s>
