<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The National Organization</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>'s president calls it ``the most important advancement of women's civil rights since the 1964 Civil Rights Act.'' This summer one federal judge upheld it; another found it unconstitutional.</s>
<s i="3">The Violence Against <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX> is in for a lengthy legal battle likely to go all the way to the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="4">The act, passed as part of the 2009 Crime <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, includes many noncontroversial items such as a national domestic violence hot line and funds for better lighting in parking lots.</s>
<s i="5">But it also has a controversial civil rights provision allowing victims of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">``gender</ENAMEX>-motivated violence'' to sue their attackers in federal court.</s>
<s i="6">This statute was struck down last month by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jacques Rudolf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Brzonkala v.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Polytechnic Institute</ENAMEX> when Derryberry dismissed <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPI</ENAMEX> student <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrystal Lines</ENAMEX>'s federal suit based on an alleged sexual assault by two members of the college's football team.</s>
<s i="8">Just a few weeks earlier in <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Janett Mullen</ENAMEX> came to the opposite conclusion in <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Janee Stearns</ENAMEX> v.</s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Stearns</ENAMEX>, in which the plaintiff claims that <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Johnetta</ENAMEX> Stearns husband, whom <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Stearns</ENAMEX> is divorcing, beat <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Stearns</ENAMEX> and treated Johnetta <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Stearns</ENAMEX> like a slave throughout 17 years of marriage.</s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jacques Rudolf</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had exceeded its authority in passing the Violence Against Women Act, since there is no basis for the federal judiciary to have jurisdiction over sexual assault and spousal abuse, crimes that properly belong in the state courts.</s>
<s i="11">According to <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Janett Mullen</ENAMEX>, however, the law was ``a proper exercise of congressional power under the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Clause</ENAMEX>'' because ``crimes of violence motivated by <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">``gender</ENAMEX>'' adversely affect interstate commerce through the victims' medical costs, diminished productivity, and even the fear that deters potential victims from taking certain jobs and traveling on business.</s>
<s i="12">In fact, the language of the law is extremely vague as to what constitutes ``gender-based violence''--``a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">``gender</ENAMEX>'' In <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Brzonkala v.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">``evidence</ENAMEX>'' of the misogynistic bias of one of the defendants is that after the alleged attack Derryberry told the young woman, ``you'd better not have any f--ing diseases'' and that on another occasion Derryberry reportedly made a crude remark expressing a preference for sex with intoxicated women.</s>
<s i="13">What is it, then, that supposedly makes rape and domestic abuse different from any other violent offenses?</s>
<s i="14">The Violence Against <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX> is based on the premise that these crimes are often rooted in antifemale bias, take such a toll on women as to effectively rob them of equal rights, and are not taken seriously by state courts and law enforcement agencies because of sexism.</s>
<s i="15">The first of these notions belongs in the realm of ideology, reflecting the radical feminist theory that rape and battering are part of a terrorist campaign by men against women.</s>
<s i="16">The other two are based on distorted statistics, cited in abundance in the congressional findings that accompany the act and, more recently, in <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headley Burch</ENAMEX>'s ruling.</s>
<s i="17">Take the findings' assertion that ``violence is the leading cause of injury to women ages 15-44, more common than automobile accidents, muggings, and cancer deaths combined.'' The 15 to 44 figure is from a study of emergency room patients in a high-crime inner-city area--hardly representative of the population at large.</s>
<s i="18">The comparison to auto accidents, muggings and cancer deaths, as <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newhouse News Service</ENAMEX> reporter <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Joel Endsley</ENAMEX> demonstrated in a 2009 story, was made up out of thin air by feminist ``advocacy researchers.'' Another factoid from the congressional findings--``About 35% of women visiting hospital emergency rooms are (there) due to injuries sustained as a result of domestic violence''--also belongs in <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Phony Statistics Hall of Fame.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19">A 2010 <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> study found that of 648 women surveyed in emergency departments, 11--fewer than 2%--were seeking treatment for a beating by a male partner.</s>
<s i="20">Besides, if being a victim of a violent crime constitutes civil rights deprivation, then men, who make up three-quarters of homicide victims and two-thirds of victims of robbery and aggravated assaults, should be the sex in need of federal protection.</s>
<s i="21">Nor is it true, at least today, that crimes that predominantly affect women are treated as ``second-class crimes.<ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">''</ENAMEX> When <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feminist</ENAMEX> criminologist <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="PERSON">Kathline Whiteside</ENAMEX> analyzed 1987-88 data from one <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> county, <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">she</ENAMEX> found, contrary to <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">she</ENAMEX> expectations, that men who assaulted their wives or girlfriends were treated no more leniently than those who attacked anyone else.</s>
<s i="22">Numerous other studies confirm this pattern.</s>
<s i="23">There is clearly no constitutional basis for creating a special class of crimes defined by <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">nebulous</ENAMEX> ideological criteria.</s>
<s i="24">Yet some defenders of the Violence Against Women are candid about their indifference to constitutional <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">niceties.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25">``We can look at it as lawyers and consider the fine points of the law,'' <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="26"><ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Lesher</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ela Willy</ENAMEX>, declared on TV``but we can look at it from the point of view of the women of this country.'' Actually, there is no evidence that many women will benefit from the civil rights statute of the act.</s>
<s i="27">For most victims of rape or domestic violence, civil litigation makes little sense since most of the perpetrators have no assets to go after.</s>
<s i="28"><ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novella</ENAMEX> Crews, the attorney for the defendant in the <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> case, argues that the law is ``a litigation weapon for upper middle class and wealthy women in divorce cases''--a way to bring a divorce case before a jury instead of simply a judge and put pressure on the husband to offer a more favorable settlement.</s>
<s i="29">In cases such as <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Brzonkala v.</ENAMEX>, the Violence Against <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX> is being used for political symbolism and publicity.</s>
<s i="30">In <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Stearns</ENAMEX> brief, <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="31"><ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ela Willy</ENAMEX> cites the media coverage the case has received and asserts that the plaintiff's goal is nothing less than to initiate ``a wide national debate about why the `no means yes' myth still persists.'' Of course this very same case was too weak to get to first base in the criminal justice system; a <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> grand jury refused to indict the alleged assailants.</s>
<s i="32">In the legal battle to come, defenders of the act are heartened by the fact that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jacques Rudolf</ENAMEX> is the same judge who has just been overruled by <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> on the issue of opening the <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Military Institute</ENAMEX> to women.</s>
<s i="33">Whatever one thinks of the <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VMI</ENAMEX> case, this one is fundamentally different: It is not about equal treatment but about special privilege for female victims of certain crimes.</s>
<s i="34">Justice <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Ruthann Walston Costello</ENAMEX>, who played a key role in the <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VMI</ENAMEX> decision, has been often described as a feminist of the old ``equality'' school who reportedly dislikes the newer brand of protectionist ``victim feminism.'' Before long, we may get a chance to see just how <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">she</ENAMEX> will apply these principles to the Violence Against Women Act.</s>
