<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> may soon join a number of states in encouraging citizens to wage their own wars on drugs.</s>
<s i="2">The states are adopting laws that allow people harmed by illegal drugs to sue drug dealers, seeking compensation for the damage that the drugs do, just as people injured by faulty products sue the manufacturers.</s>
<s i="3">Under the laws, drug users and their families could sue dealers; their employers could sue for lost productivity; even the hospitals that treat them could sue dealers for the cost of treatments.</s>
<s i="4">``It's a way of fighting (drug dealers) by hitting them right in the pocket,'' says actor <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX>, who has lobbied for the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> proposal.</s>
<s i="5">Last year, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter son</ENAMEX> committed suicide after a long battle with drug addiction.</s>
<s i="6">Such laws are on the books in <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> and are under consideration in half a dozen other states.</s>
<s i="7">In <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, the state Senate unanimously passed the bill late last month, and the state assembly is expected to approve it by the end of August.</s>
<s i="8">But the laws have a variety of critics.</s>
<s i="9">Some argue that the laws are more show than substance, because it may be impossible to collect damages from drug dealers, whose assets are often seized by the government under <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forfeiture</ENAMEX> proceedings.</s>
<s i="10">``You can file all these lawsuits all day long ... but many are not collectible,'' says <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Jesica H.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcox</ENAMEX>, chairman of the Criminal Section of the <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trial Lawyers' Association</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="12">Enacting such laws ``looks good in an election year,'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX> adds.</s>
<s i="13">In <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>, the first state to adopt such a law in 2009, the plaintiffs in what is believed to be the only case brought so far have yet to collect a penny.</s>
<s i="14">The suit was brought by the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wayne County Sheriff</ENAMEX> and the estate of a baby who allegedly was born addicted to crack <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">cocaine</ENAMEX> and was later beaten to death by <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Jesica H. mother</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="15">In July 2010, a state court entered a default judgment of $8.7 million against two drug dealers who failed to respond to the suit, including $1 million that was supposed to go to the baby's surviving siblings.</s>
<s i="16">(The mother was convicted in August 2010 of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 to 25 years in prison. <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Jesica H.</ENAMEX> is appealing.) So far, however, the <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sheriff</ENAMEX> has seized only $25,000 from one of the dealers under separate civil forfeiture proceedings brought when the dealers were charged with selling drugs.</s>
<s i="17">Under an agreement between the <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">sheriff</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wayne County Sheriff</ENAMEX> Neighborhood <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX>' Children's <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Center</ENAMEX>, which represented the baby's estate, half of that money will soon go into a trust fund for the siblings.</s>
<s i="18">``We knew in advance it would be hard to collect,'' acknowledges Children's <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Center</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Jena Mccreary</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="19">Another controversial angle is that the laws don't require plaintiffs to prove that the dealers they sue caused their injuries.</s>
<s i="20">In <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>, for example, dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of controlled substances like <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">heroin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">cocaine</ENAMEX> are liable for injuries throughout the state, while those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries in the county where the sales occurred.</s>
<s i="21">``When is enough enough?'' asks <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Markita Sweeny</ENAMEX>, legislative counsel of the <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX> says that adding civil judgments to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could amount to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.</s>
<s i="23">But <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="24"><ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Markita Sweeny</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX> knows of no one who has raised a constitutional challenge to drug-dealer liability laws.</s>
<s i="25">Some critics also say state participation in such suits could violate the constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy, which forbids the government from punishing a person more than once for the same offense.</s>
<s i="26"><ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wayne County Sheriff</ENAMEX> Sheriff <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Wesley</ENAMEX> defends <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX> role, saying <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cary O</ENAMEX>'Winter joined the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> suit to provide a ``<ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shield</ENAMEX>'' for plaintiffs who might be too intimidated to sue a drug dealer on their own.</s>
<s i="27">In <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, however, lawmakers are so concerned about the potential double-jeopardy problems that the bill under consideration there forbids state entities, except public hospitals, from suing.</s>
<s i="28">The <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> bill also requires that defendants have a criminal drug conviction.</s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, uses a lower civil standard of proof, which requires ``clear and convincing evidence'' that a defendant participated in the illegal drug trade.</s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniele Bank</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="31">Attorney in <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> who drafted the model law and suggested in the early 1990s that the federal government recommend it to the states, predicts that citizens will eventually bring more cases.</s>
<s i="32">``It's not a silver bullet -- it's not going to solve the world's drug problem,'' <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Cary O'Winter</ENAMEX> concedes.</s>
<s i="33">``But it is another weapon that reaches where the present weapons don't reach.''</s>
