<s i="1">MADRID -- After eight months of legal battling, auditor <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> agreed to pay rival <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers &amp; Lybrand Settles</ENAMEX> a sum that wasn't disclosed, ending <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s biggest-ever employee-poaching scuffle.</s>
<s i="2">In a joint statement, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers &amp; Lybrand Settles</ENAMEX> said it would drop legal action against <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> in exchange for ``monetary compensation.'' Neither auditor would reveal any further information about the agreement or the amount paid, which news reports estimated near $5 million.</s>
<s i="3">In the statement, <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> said it ``regrets the situation created.'' The litigation began in November when <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers &amp; Lybrand Settles</ENAMEX> filed suit in a <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Madrid</ENAMEX> court, alleging that <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> had poached 91 employees from its highly profitable consulting division, including six partners and three directors.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers &amp; Lybrand Settles</ENAMEX> charged that when <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX> hired the employees, it violated a 1993 Spanish law on unfair competition, which stipulates that departing personnel must notify their firms three months before leaving or risk losing part of their salary.</s>
<s i="5">Then, a judge ordered <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst &amp; Young</ENAMEX>, who maintained it had ``acted within the ethical principles of professional activity,'' to delay the partners' contracts for six months as a cautionary measure.</s>
<s i="6">After a <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Madrid</ENAMEX> court upheld the judge's decision earlier this month, the two parties settled the dispute away from the bench.</s>
