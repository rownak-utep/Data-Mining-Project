Man Builds Bomb in Vastapolis..
Could your neighbor be an extremely dangerous person with a bomb?
Well today, authorities uncovered components needed to construct an Improvised Explosive Device in the living room of a house in Suburbia.
The police came when they received a call about a lot of noise coming from the house.
Upon entering the house they discovered a 60 year old man with all the equipment necessary for building an Improvised Explosive Device.
The police immediately arrested the man.
When the old man was brought back to the police station he was put under intense questioning, according to Police Officer Eve Purvines.
Eve Purvines informed VastPress that he neighbors had a cat, KeeKee, who wouldn't stop going to the bathroom on the old man's lilies.
This apparently infuriated the old man and drove KeeKee to the point of attempting to build an IED for dealing with the cat.
At the end of the day, the old man is now going to trial for being in possession of the Improvised Explosive Device and KeeKee is still alright.
