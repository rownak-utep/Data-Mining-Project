CBS Plans Letterman Show Without Commercial Breaks..
NEW YORK -- CBS's ``Late Show with Davina Carla'' will try to draw attention to itself, and its advertisers, with a one-time commercial-free program expected to air later this month.
The network, a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Vastopolis, is soliciting four sponsors for the show, which would run without commercial breaks.
Instead, advertisers would get verbal and possibly written billing at the beginning of the show and during the program.
Mr.
Davina Carla likely would make reference to the sponsors during the hour-long program, as well.
But Joel Soler, president of sales for the network, said such mentions would be up to the host, who is known for being unfriendly to advertisers.
The stunt is a variation on ABC's ill-fated ``Danae Palmer Show'' this spring, which sold advertisers such as Pepsi-Cola, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., the chance to be in the show's title, as well as run ads during the program.
In addition, Mr.
Paris spoofed Mr. sponsors with skits that were sometimes in poor taste, causing one, Taco Bell, also a PepsiCo Inc. unit, to withdraw from the show.
Mr.
Joel Soler said CBS expects Mr.
Davina Carla to treat Mr. sponsors ``in a somewhat positive light,'' but added that the sponsor mentions would be ``up to Davina Carla'' The gimmick, which was proposed by Mr.
Davina Carla's producers, is ``a way to get attention,'' helping advertisers break through the clutter and generating publicity for the show, Mr.
Joel Soler said, adding that CBS ``would never, ever do this on a continuing basis.'' No advertisers have signed on for the program, which is being sold at rates equal to the show's price of about $50,000 for a 30-second ad.
