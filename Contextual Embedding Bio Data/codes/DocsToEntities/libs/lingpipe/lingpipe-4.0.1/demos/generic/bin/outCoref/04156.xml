<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Well</ENAMEX> today, authorities uncovered components needed to construct an Improvised Explosive Device in the living room of a house in <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Suburbia</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="3">The police came when they received a call about a lot of <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noise</ENAMEX> coming from the house.</s>
<s i="4">Upon entering the house they discovered a 60 year old man with all the equipment necessary for building an Improvised <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explosive Device</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="5">The police immediately arrested the man.</s>
<s i="6">When the old man was brought back to the police station <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> was put under intense questioning, according to <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Officer Eve Purvines</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eve Purvines</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VastPress</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> neighbors had a cat, <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">KeeKee</ENAMEX>, who wouldn't stop going to the bathroom on the old man's lilies.</s>
<s i="8">This apparently infuriated the old man and drove <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">KeeKee</ENAMEX> to the point of attempting to build an IED for dealing with the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">cat.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="9">At the end of the day, the old man is now going to trial for being in possession of the Improvised <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explosive Device</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">KeeKee</ENAMEX> is still alright.</s>
