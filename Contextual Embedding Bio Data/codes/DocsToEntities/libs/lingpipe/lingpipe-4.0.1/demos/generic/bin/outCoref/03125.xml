<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> told a jury.</s>

<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX>, who has pleaded guilty to six felonies related to the scheme, also said it was <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> assistant <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Maud Logan</ENAMEX>'s idea to skim other people's interest into a county-controlled account.</s>
<s i="5">In December 2009, after <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX>'s risky investments lost $1.6 billion, the county filed the biggest-ever <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> municipal bankruptcy.</s>
<s i="7">But in early 1993, when the diversions began, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> returns were huge.</s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> was proud of that, but <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Maud Logan</ENAMEX> worried the yields were so high they would spook investors.</s>
<s i="10">``<ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Maud Logan</ENAMEX> came to me and said ... the pool investors would see something wrong in that and pull their money out,'' <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> testified.</s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> agreed to transfer some money from the treasury's pool of commingled funds to the county general fund.</s>
<s i="14">Assistant <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Orange County</ENAMEX> District Attorney <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Janae Norberto</ENAMEX> asked if the 200 noncounty pool participants had consented to the plan.</s>

<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX>, cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a light sentence, testified at the trial of former <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county Budget Director Roni S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="20">Roseberry on two counts of aiding and abetting the illegal scheme.</s>
<s i="21"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22">Roseberry was jubilant to learn that the county budget, impoverished by recession and state budget cuts, would have new funds.</s>
<s i="23"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="24">Roseberry set up the Economic Uncertainty Fund into which the skimmed interest was funneled, and decided to let the county supervisors touch only the interest the funds earned, not the principal, <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> testified.</s>
<s i="26">But <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> never disclosed to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="27">Roseberry the fact that interest was being underreported to schools, cities and agencies.</s>

<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> only told one other person: <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Palmira</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> salesman with whom <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonnell</ENAMEX> spoke every day and who had sold the county the bulk of the interest-rate-sensitive securities that ultimately brought down the treasury.</s>
<s i="33"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> had great respect for <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>'s financial advice and, using it, became convinced that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> had ``perfected'' the use of high-risk borrowing techniques so the county couldn't lose money.</s>

<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Palmira</ENAMEX> never was involved in any internal allocation of funds at the county and denied <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> was aware that too little interest was paid to the noncounty investors in the treasury.</s>
<s i="37"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, denying any wrongdoing in the case, is battling a $2 billion civil suit in which the county contends it must share the blame for the investment losses.</s>

<s i="44">A stutterer all <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonnell</ENAMEX> life, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> stammered and hesitated slightly on some occasions.</s>
<s i="45">But <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> seemed generally composed and better able to express himself than at a state Senate hearing in early 2010, when <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Bonnell</ENAMEX> often seemed flustered or gave rambling answers.</s>

<s i="48">Roseberry directly in wrongdoing follows a series of rulings that have hampered the prosecution.</s>
<s i="49">The most severe is <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superior Court Headley Stephine Amaro</ENAMEX>'s ruling that <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="50"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Maud Logan</ENAMEX>'s grand jury testimony is inadmissible.</s>
