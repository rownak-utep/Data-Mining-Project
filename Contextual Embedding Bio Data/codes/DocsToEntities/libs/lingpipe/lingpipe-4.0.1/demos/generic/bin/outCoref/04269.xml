<s i="1">The case that <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> settled involved <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Rolando Avant</ENAMEX>, the head of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asylum Policy and Review Office</ENAMEX> under Presidents <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Reatha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Vern</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="2">In 1989, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="3">Avant and <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> wife <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann</ENAMEX> were falsely and publicly cited in a <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> report for the serious crime of leaking classified documents to the apartheid South African regime.</s>
<s i="4">They have since had to endure a <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">Kafkaesque</ENAMEX> nightmare to restore their good names.</s>
<s i="5">The charges originated in an <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> background check of <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">Mrs.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6">Avant when <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> was nominated to be an assistant secretary of the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="7">Wiretaps of a South African diplomat at the <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> turned up an ambiguous reference by Mrs.</s>
<s i="8">Avant to sending <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> documents, which <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> ethics officials interpreted as meaning <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> had leaked a confidential State Department document.</s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10">Avant was put on leave and had <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr.</ENAMEX> security clearance lifted, while Mrs.</s>
<s i="11">Avant's nomination was withdrawn.</s>
<s i="12">A subsequent investigation exonerated them and <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13">Avant was reinstated, but not before a confidential memo on the charges was leaked to the media and <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s ethics office issued a report saying there was ``sufficient cause'' to ``terminate'' <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="14">Avant's appointment.</s>
<s i="15">The Privacy Act was created during the Watergate era to ensure that personal information on citizens is never used or made available unless it ``is for a necessary and legal purpose.'' The indiscriminate collecting of sensitive <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> files by the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is potentially the most serious abuse of the Privacy Act ever.</s>
<s i="16"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Evan</ENAMEX>, a former staff director of the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Government Information Subcommittee, says the <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> may also have been violating the letter of the Privacy Act for the past 20 years.</s>
<s i="17">The law authorizes the <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to share sensitive files only with a bona fide federal ``agency,'' which the <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Counsel's Office</ENAMEX> is not.</s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> Counsel <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Howard Shapiro</ENAMEX> concedes <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Evan</ENAMEX>'s point, but says <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> argument is ``beside the point'' because the Privacy Act has a ``routine use'' provision that authorizes it to share files with the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="20">Sounds to us as if Congressional hearings are needed to see if the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> have used similar logic to justify additional skirtings of the Privacy Act.</s>
<s i="21">As for <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22">Avant, <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> says the same ethics watchdogs who abused Mr. and <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Juliann</ENAMEX> are still in charge at <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="23"><ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> says the large settlement in Mr. <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">case</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s supine turning over of files to the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> mean it's time to ``clean house'' at <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="24">After all, what the <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilons</ENAMEX> endured could have happened to some of the hundreds of people whose files were pored over by the opposition <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">``research</ENAMEX>'' team of <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Cristobal Dupuis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Antoinette Henke</ENAMEX>.</s>
