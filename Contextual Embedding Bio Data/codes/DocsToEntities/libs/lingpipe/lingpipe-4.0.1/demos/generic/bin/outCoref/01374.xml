<s i="1">HOUSTON -- The trial lawyers who've turned <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Silicone City</ENAMEX> -- the center of multi-billion dollar lawsuits against manufacturers of silicone gel breast implants -- like to think of themselves as knights in shining armor doing battle against evil corporations on behalf of helpless <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">maidens.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="2">But what happens when the lawyers' crusade inadvertently maims a woman, leaving <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> without breasts and without hope?</s>
<s i="3">That's precisely what happened to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>, yet a local judge ensured that the attorneys don't risk suffering the same kind of rough justice they like to mete out.</s>
<s i="4">Ms.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> is a 48-year-old housewife who received implants in 1979.</s>
<s i="6">Like many other women <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> was scared stiff by all the adverse publicity about breast implants -- ``ticking time bombs,'' the lawyers called them -- so in January 1992 <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Rachael, Chambers, McAninch &amp; Laminack</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7">Run by the legendary <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>, who according to <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes magazine</ENAMEX> made $40 million last year (a number <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> denies), the law firm was amassing some 2,000 breast implant plaintiffs.</s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>'s partner, <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Ricki Yi</ENAMEX>, quickly put <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> on the medical assembly line set up to process plaintiffs.</s>
<s i="11">TD The <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">O'Quyen</ENAMEX> law firm first directed Ms.</s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Grady</ENAMEX>, an ``expert'' witness who has seen 1,500 women and who, according to a ``60 <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minutes</ENAMEX>'' report, makes $500 an hour testifying in court.</s>
<s i="13">After Dr. <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Grady</ENAMEX> examined <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> and sent detailed reports back to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Ricki Yi</ENAMEX>, the law firm sent Ms.</s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">L.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="16"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fausto Blount Mueller</ENAMEX>, another expert witness, a plastic surgeon who's removed implants from at least 1,000 women.</s>
<s i="17">Dr. <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Blount</ENAMEX> performed the operation on <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> in March 1992.</s>
<s i="19">The implants and biopsy samples wound up at the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">O'Quinn</ENAMEX> law firm, where they were stored in a refrigerated ``Tupperware-type container'' along with hundreds of others -- a ghoulish display of evidence.</s>
<s i="20">This is the norm for breast implant cases, but <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Arvilla Meehan</ENAMEX>, director of the Center for Bioethics at <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, describes this set-up as ``reprehensible.'' First, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> says, ``the hired gun, or expert witness, and the direct patient advocate -- those roles should always be split, not combined,'' as they were in this case.</s>
<s i="21">Second, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> says, having a law firm store tissues is ``very odd... When a pathology department stores and keeps materials, they abide by certain regulations.</s>
<s i="22">When a law firm keeps them -- or if you or I keep them in our basement -- it's not clear that they're intact and properly stored.'' That, indeed, later became an issue in this case.</s>
<s i="23">The <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">O'Quinn</ENAMEX> law firm sent Ms.</s>
<s i="24"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'s tissue samples for testing to <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the State University of New York Health Science Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Syracuse</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="25">The doctor reported back that the tissues didn't show any ``foreign material,'' a result that would have hurt <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="26"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>'s legal case because it would indicate no silicone had leaked from the implants.</s>
<s i="27">The firm then paid $1,680 to have the tissues and implants tested by <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Scott Ocampo</ENAMEX>, a pathologist at <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinai Medical Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> who is a frequent expert witness.</s>
<s i="28"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> reported back with an alarming finding: the tissue contained ``intraductal <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">carcinoma.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breast</ENAMEX> cancer.</s>
<s i="29">In December 1992, Dr. <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Blount</ENAMEX> called in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="PERSON">told Maryalice Curley Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'d have to consider a double mastectomy.</s>
<s i="31">Although a mammogram was negative, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> did have a surgeon remove both <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">breasts.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="33">But when the pathology report came back, it turned out <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> didn't have breast cancer.</s>
<s i="35">It now appears that the tissue that tested positive for <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> may not have been Ms.</s>
<s i="36"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'s -- one DNA test found the tissue wasn't <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>, while another was inconclusive.</s>
<s i="37">In short, due to a horrifying mix-up either at the <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">O'Quinn</ENAMEX> law firm or at one of the doctors' offices, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="38"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> had needlessly undergone a double mastectomy.</s>
<s i="39">And due to the way the scar tissue has formed, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> won't be able to have breast reconstruction.</s>
<s i="40">Incidentally, if <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="41"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'s tissue samples were switched, it means that another woman actually had breast cancer but didn't realize it.</s>
<s i="42">Nobody knows who <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> is, or whether <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'s still alive.</s>
<s i="43"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="44"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> insists ``we've done nothing wrong.'' <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> says the mix-up occurred ``in a lab somewhere,'' but adds, ``If I were <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>, I'd be mad as hell, too.'' In fact, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> was so mad that <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> did what Mr.</s>
<s i="45"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> likes to do: <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> sued everyone in sight, which in this case meant the <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> law firm as well as the doctors.</s>
<s i="46">Normally <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="47"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> might have expected <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> case -- no matter the merits -- to get a sympathetic hearing in the plaintiff's paradise of <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris County.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="48">But, as <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> quickly discovered, a plaintiff's odds of prevailing change dramatically when the defendant isn't an out-of-state corporation but a famous local trial attorney.</s>
<s i="49">The complaint against <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="50"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> never even made it to a jury.</s>
<s i="51">On March 17, 2009 <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epstein Carolynn English Jona</ENAMEX> issued summary judgment in favor of the <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX>'Quyen law firm, a decision not based on any published finding of fact.</s>
<s i="52">(The case against two of the doctors is proceeding outside <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.) The judgment, which <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> refuses to publicly explain, is defensible on the merits, but it should raise a few eyebrows when considered in light of <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> history.</s>
<s i="53">It turns out that the judge, as much as anyone, has been responsible for helping the local plaintiffs' attorneys make a fortune from their weak breast implant claims.</s>
<s i="54">Who is <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX>?</s>
<s i="55">The wife of personal injury attorney <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="PERSON">Jamal Jona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">her</ENAMEX> was appointed to a vacancy on the bench in 1993 by then-<ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="LOCATION">Gov.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="56"><ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Annabel Johnston</ENAMEX>, who had received $155,000 in contributions from <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> over the years.</s>
<s i="57">During last year's campaign (all judges in <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> are elected), <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="58"><ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Jona</ENAMEX>'s Republican opponent, <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="PERSON">Davina J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="59"><ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer</ENAMEX>, charged that <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="60"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>'s influence was responsible for putting <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> on the bench.</s>
<s i="61">Both <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="62"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="63"><ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Jona</ENAMEX> deny the accusation.</s>
<s i="64">What's undeniable is that since <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> appointment, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> has acquired a reputation among local lawyers as a plaintiff's judge, not a fair judge.</s>
<s i="65">In a 2010 <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houston Bar Association</ENAMEX> survey, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> received the second highest ``poor'' rating among the 19 state <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil District Court</ENAMEX> judges in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="66">During a Republican landslide in 2009, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="67"><ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Jona</ENAMEX> was the only Democratic judge to win a race in <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="LOCATION">Harris County</ENAMEX>..</s>
<s i="68"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> narrow victory -- <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> prevailed by less than half a percentage point over <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="69"><ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmer</ENAMEX> -- can be attributed in part to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> prodigious fundraising.</s>
<s i="70">According to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> campaign disclosure forms, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> received $402,768.73, mainly from plaintiffs' lawyers.</s>
<s i="71"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> largest single donation -- $6,250 -- came from <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="72"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> on July 20, 2008 Four months later, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> presided over a whopping $27.9 million jury verdict against breast implant manufacturers 3M, <ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGhan Medical Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inamed.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="73">The plaintiffs' attorney?</s>
<s i="74"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="75">``The verdict helped set the market price for breast implant cases,'' says <ENAMEX ID="44" TYPE="PERSON">Jone Anders</ENAMEX> of Citizens Against <ENAMEX ID="45" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawsuit Abuse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="76">Thanks to the verdict in <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX>'s court, it was a very generous price for <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="77"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">O'Rachael</ENAMEX>, who typically takes 40% of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Rachael</ENAMEX> clients' winnings.</s>
<s i="78">Last year, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> presided over two implant cases brought against <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter Healthcare</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="79">By Friday, August 13, 2009 the jury had been out for 10 days, and consternation was growing among the plaintiffs' attorneys, who had expected a quick verdict in their favor.</s>
<s i="80">Suddenly, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> granted their motion for a mistrial, claiming that the jury had been unable to reach a verdict.</s>
<s i="81">The jurors were so outraged that 11 of them together issued a rare public statement protesting the judge's decision.</s>
<s i="82">In their statement, the jurors said they were ``making substantial progress'' -- they had already decided in favor of the implant manufacturers in one case, and were within a day or two of a verdict in the other case.</s>
<s i="83">``We are appalled,'' the jury added, ``at not being asked if we were making progress during the latter days of the deliberations.'' <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> Jona <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Jona later</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Chronicle that the jurors ``did not fully understand the court process.'' But they thought they did: As one juror told the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houston Post</ENAMEX>, ``I think when the plaintiffs saw it wasn't going in their favor, they decided to pull <ENAMEX ID="47" TYPE="LOCATION">out.</ENAMEX>'' By granting a mistrial, <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> stopped the jury from issuing <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris County.</ENAMEX>'s first-ever verdict in favor of breast implant manufacturers.</s>
<s i="84">(At a retrial this fall, Snow won the case anyway -- in a different courtroom.) Here is the irony of <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX>'s jurisprudence: In the breast implant litigation, where multiple studies have shown there is not a shred of scientific evidence that the plaintiffs suffered any harm caused by the manufacturers, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> has allowed the charges to go to a jury.</s>
<s i="85">Yet in <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX>'s case -- where the harm suffered was undeniable, though the culprit was unclear -- <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX> tossed out the case early on.</s>
<s i="86">Now the outlook for <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="87"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> isn't good.</s>
<s i="88">The <ENAMEX ID="48" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> is scheduled to hear <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> case soon, but even if it rules in <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> favor, the probable result would be to send <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Maryalice Curley</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Jona</ENAMEX>'s courtroom, where the breast implant lawyers have a long record of success.</s>
