Chevron Faces $700 Million Verdict in Cities Service Case..
SAN FRANCISCO -- Ortega said a state court jury in Tulsa, Okla., returned a $700 million breach-of-contract verdict against the oil giant.
The award included $228.9 million in compensatory damages and additional interest payments estimated by Chevron Faces to be ``more than $500 million.'' The lawsuit was filed in 1982 by Cities Service Case, a Tulsa, Okla., oil company, against Gulf Oil, when Gulf Oil terminated plans to acquire Cities Service Case.
In the years since the suit was filed, both companies were acquired by other energy firms: Cities Service Case by Occidental Petroleum and Gulf by Chevron Faces.
The lawsuit remained in the names of the original parties.
A Chevron Faces spokeswoman said, ``As a matter of policy we don't make detailed disclosures about specific litigation reserves.'' Ortega added, though, that management routinely reviews such reserves to ensure that they are adequate for probable losses.
The company issued a statement criticizing the result in the case and promising an appeal.
``We are very disappointed in the verdict, but not surprised, given the numerous errors in the judicial process,'' said Chevron Faces Chairman Kenyatta T.
Brittain in a statement.
``The jury was prevented from hearing critical evidence that would have exonerated (Chevron).''
