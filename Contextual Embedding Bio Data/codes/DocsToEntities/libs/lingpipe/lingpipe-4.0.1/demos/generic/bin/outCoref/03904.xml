<s i="1">Franchise owners often live in fear of being crowded out by competition -- from their own company.</s>
<s i="2">Outlets, especially fast-food restaurants, multiply so rapidly that new shops sometimes open just a mile or so from an established one.</s>
<s i="3">But a recent ruling by the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Ninth U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> has given hope to franchisees, who until now have gotten little protection from the courts.</s>
<s i="5">In the ruling, a three-member panel of the appeals court concluded that a Mexican restaurant chain called <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naugles Inc.</ENAMEX> breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing with franchisee Vylene <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX> by building a new site 1.4 miles from the restaurant operated by <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tims</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="6">Such an implied agreement is in all contracts in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, and in most states, the court ruled.</s>
<s i="7">It also upheld a lower court's award of $2.2 million in damages to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Vylene</ENAMEX>, plus attorneys' fees and costs of $550,000.</s>
<s i="8">The decision, which didn't say how close is too close, could affect other cases brought by unhappy franchisees.</s>
<s i="9">A <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's Corp.</ENAMEX> case is now before the same court, and cases involving the <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Subway sandwich</ENAMEX> chain and <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvel Corp.</ENAMEX> ice-cream chain are pending elsewhere.</s>
<s i="10">The <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> court is the highest in the land to take up the issue; while its decision applies only to cases in Western states, other appeals courts often follow its lead.</s>
<s i="11">``Lawyers representing franchisees will find this case to be very potent ammunition in efforts to challenge expansion decisions by franchisers,'' says <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Lezlie Riccio</ENAMEX>, senior partner in the <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudnick &amp; Wolfe.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12">Franchisees are cheering the ruling.</s>
<s i="13">Encroachment -- when a franchiser opens another outlet nearby -- is ``the No. 1 problem'' for <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lezlie Riccio</ENAMEX> organization, says <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Susann Samons</ENAMEX>, president of the 7,000-member <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Franchisee Association</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="14">``It crosses brand names, from automotive to accessories to business services.'' <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Diego Baker</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> consultant who is a spokesman for a <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX>'s franchisee group called the Consortium, says, ``We're going to take a good hard look at (the decision) because, with <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crysta's</ENAMEX>' rapid development program and the encroachment effect it's having, this could be a big issue for <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">us.</ENAMEX>'' Before the appeals court ruling, there was little support for franchisees confronted with such competition.</s>
<s i="15">Franchisers typically prevailed.</s>
<s i="16">A 1991 federal court ruling allowing a <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Burger King</ENAMEX> franchisee to pursue an encroachment claim was watered down in subsequent rulings.</s>
<s i="17">In a <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Burger King</ENAMEX> case last year, for example, another federal judge in the same district decided that the opening of a restaurant on a military base near a franchisee's two <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Burger Kings</ENAMEX> didn't violate the franchise's implied fair-dealing agreement.</s>
<s i="18">Franchisers often argue that they can do as they please because their contracts don't provide exclusive territories.</s>
<s i="19">But a lawyer for <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvel Corp.</ENAMEX> franchisees, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Keli Patrina</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Boca Raton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, says the appeals court took ``a very common-sense approach'' to the question of what's fair to both sides.</s>
<s i="20">In their case, 72 Carvel franchisees are suing the chain of <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ice</ENAMEX>-cream shops in federal court in <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> for allegedly breaching the implied covenant by selling ice cream directly to supermarkets within a franchisee's trading area.</s>
<s i="21">``Many franchisers have tried to limit the scope of the contract to what it says in black and white,'' says <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="PERSON">Anette Adalberto</ENAMEX> of the law firm of <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burch &amp; Cracchiolo.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22">``This says that no matter what the contract says, you've got to deal fairly with one another.'' The <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tims</ENAMEX> case began as a bankruptcy-court action.</s>
<s i="23">Behind on fees and rent payments to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naugles Inc.</ENAMEX>, the franchisee filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in 1983 and continued to operate.</s>
<s i="24">In 1985, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naugles Inc.</ENAMEX> opened a company-owned restaurant near <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Vylene</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, location.</s>
<s i="25">``It is undisputed that the new restaurant had a negative impact on <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tims</ENAMEX>'s sales,'' the appeals court said, agreeing with the bankruptcy court.</s>
<s i="26">The bankruptcy judge also found that while <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Throckmorton</ENAMEX> didn't have an exclusive territory, franchiser <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">Windham</ENAMEX> had breached not only the franchise agreement but also the <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="PERSON">covenant</ENAMEX> of good faith and fair dealing by opening the competing restaurant nearby.</s>
<s i="27">Attorneys for <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naugles Inc.</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment on whether they planned to seek a review by the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Ninth U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="28"><ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="29">And <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Throckmorton's</ENAMEX> lawyer didn't return phone calls.</s>
<s i="30">If allowed to stand, ``this will invite a host of litigation,'' predicts <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Erinn B.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="31"><ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="PERSON">Unruh</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, law firm of <ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogan &amp; Hartson</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="32">``It raises the specter that every time you open up a new restaurant that could possibly have an impact on an existing unit, that franchisee may have a legal claim against you.'' The appeals court decision reflects an evolution in judicial thinking about balancing the rights of franchisers and franchisees, says <ENAMEX ID="44" TYPE="PERSON">H.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="33"><ENAMEX ID="45" TYPE="PERSON">Stephine Dean</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="PERSON">Bogatin Law</ENAMEX> Firm in <ENAMEX ID="47" TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="48" TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn..</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> adds: ``The courts are saying more and more that bad faith will not be tolerated.''</s>
