<s i="3">The grounds for <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> decision are technical.</s>
<s i="4">The judge said that <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">his</ENAMEX> incorrectly omitted the word ``alone'' from the following jury instruction: ``Evidence of the defendant's honesty, truthfulness and veracity and law-abidingness alone may create a reasonable doubt whether the government proved that the defendant committed the crime.''
