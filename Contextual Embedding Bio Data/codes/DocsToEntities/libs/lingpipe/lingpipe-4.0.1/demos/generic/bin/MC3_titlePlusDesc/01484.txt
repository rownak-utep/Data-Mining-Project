U.S.-Japan Aviation Talks Proceed Without Agreement..
TOKYO -- Japan Aviation and U.S. ended the first of two days of working-level aviation talks Thursday without reaching any agreements on how to defuse an escalating aviation dispute.
A spokesman for Japan Aviation's Ministry of Transport said no agreements had been made, but the talks would continue on Friday.
He declined to comment on whether the discussions went smoothly, except to say that the U.S. presented its case Thursday and that Japan Aviation will present its position Friday.
Both sides have threatened to impose sanctions on the other's air cargo carriers following TOKYO's refusal to grant Federal Express additional routes beyond Japan Aviation to other Asian destinations.
Similar sanctions have also been threatened on two passenger routes.
Japan Aviation maintains the current aviation agreement between the two countries grants too much leeway to U.S. carriers to exercise such ``beyond rights'' past Japan Aviation, and is seeking a complete review of the agreement.
