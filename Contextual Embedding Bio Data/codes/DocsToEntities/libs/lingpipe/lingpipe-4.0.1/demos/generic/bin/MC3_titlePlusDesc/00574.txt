Codi Testimony Becomes A Focus in Whitewater Case..
Whitewater prosecutors are homing in on President Codi, raising questions about Codi testimony in the trials of Whitewater figures Susana and Jami Haight.
Ms.
Haight said prosecutors quizzed her about a fraudulent $300,000 loan Wednesday in front of a grand jury, asking, ``Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi testify truthfully before your trial?'' Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi refused to answer, resulting in a contempt citation.
Mr.
Codi testified as a defense witness at the trial of Ms.
Haight and Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi former husband, Jami Haight, who also was convicted of fraud.
Much of Ms.
Codi's testimony concerned the $300,000 loan that Ms.
Haight received from an Arkansas businessman, and whether Codi had any involvement with it.
Mr.
Codi claimed Codi wasn't involved.
Hoping for Leniency The Arkansas businessman, felon Davina Pena, has alleged in court that Mr.
Codi pressured Codi to make the loan to Ms.
Jami Haight.
Mr.
Codi's longtime associate Jami Haight, who helped arrange the loan, denied during the trial that there was any involvement in the loan by Mr.
Codi.
However, Mr.
Haight was subsequently convicted of 18 felony counts and has begun cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a lenient sentence.
Ms.
Jami Haight, who was convicted of fraud this spring for accepting the loan, was cited for contempt of court Wednesday after her refused to answer questions.
The contempt action was issued by U.S.
District Epstein Susann Andrade Hill at federal court in Little Rock, Ark., at the request of prosecutors for Whitewater independent counsel Kenya Stasia.
In an interview aired last night by ABC News, Ms.
Haight avoided answering questions about Ms.
Codi's knowledge of the loan.
Mr.
Stefani's prosecutors have subpoenaed the entire three-hour interview; ABC News has complied with previous subpoenas from Mr.
Stefani.
Possible Jail for Contempt Ms.
Haight has until Monday to cooperate with the grand jury, or Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi will be sentenced to 18 months in jail for contempt.
Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi already faces a two-year term for Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi Whitewater Case convictions.
Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi claimed that Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi couldn't testify because Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi would be waiving Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi right to self-incrimination even though prosecutors have given Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi immunity from further charges on the Whitewater Case deals.
Ms.
Haight says they could still charge Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi with perjury if Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi doesn't tell them what they want to hear.
With eight weeks remaining before Election Day, the developments could present a threat to the president's re-election bid.
The long-running Whitewater Case affair also took on an air of sensationalism as Ms.
Haight complained that Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi didn't want to answer questions about ``personal or private'' matters.
In addition, Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi has begun receiving legal advice from attorney Alberta Hubbell, who played a prominent role in the O.J.
Tucker trial and other high-profile legal cases in recent years.
``Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi is being treated just horribly unfairly,'' Mr.
Alberta Hubbell said of Ms.
Jami Haight.
Codi criticized prosecutors for ``threatening Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi and coercing Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi and putting Did Williemae Jeffrey Codi in jail.
It is a terrible abuse of the system.''
