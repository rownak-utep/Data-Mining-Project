<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> has plaintiffs' lawyers on the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">run.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="2">In the past year, the court has placed substantial hurdles in the paths of lawyers who bring large class-action suits.</s>
<s i="3">It has continued to reject attempts to expand the reach of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</s>
<s i="4">And it has tightened restrictions on the use of expert witnesses in injury cases.</s>
<s i="5">The pro-defense trend was generally good news for business, whose support has helped elect justices who tend to resist attempts to make it easier to file and win lawsuits.</s>
<s i="6">But when business interests were on the plaintiff side, they didn't fare any better than consumers.</s>
<s i="7">Nevertheless, though the court has a solid 7-2 Republican majority, it hasn't actually thrown out many rulings of the more pro-plaintiff court of the 1980s.</s>
<s i="8">``What you're seeing is much more refining of (legal) standards,'' says <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Shanta Madden</ENAMEX>, who represents businesses before the court.</s>
<s i="9">``I don't see this court going out and <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">willy-nilly</ENAMEX> overturning precedent.'' Unlike the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, the state's highest civil court doesn't divide its year into formal terms.</s>
<s i="11">But the start of the panel's lengthy summer break provides an opportunity to review some of the past year's significant business cases.</s>
<s i="12">Class Actions In a lawsuit over <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> pickup trucks, the court was hailed by both business and consumer advocates for dealing a blow to some of the most pernicious abuses of class-action lawsuits.</s>
<s i="13">The losers: trial lawyers hoping to cash in on quick settlement of class-action claims.</s>
<s i="14">The suit was brought on behalf of 650,000 owners of pre-1988 <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> full-size pickups, whose side-mounted gas tanks were prone to explosive fires, critics claimed.</s>
<s i="15">A group of attorneys and the auto maker in 1993 reached a settlement that would have given pickup owners a $1,000 coupon toward the purchase of a new <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> vehicle.</s>
<s i="16">The settlement was challenged by some truck owners who claimed the deal was unfair to consumers while enriching the plaintiffs' lawyers, who received $9 million in fees plus legal costs, under the settlement.</s>
<s i="17">The court, in a unanimous decision by <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Johnetta Greene</ENAMEX>, said that when truck owners were asked to approve the settlement, they should have been told how much the lawyers would be taking home.</s>
<s i="18">Otherwise, Justice <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Cornyn</ENAMEX> wrote, ``class members cannot determine the possible influence of attorney's fees on the settlement.'' More important, the decision said that class-action settlements like this one, which was reached without much court oversight, must undergo court scrutiny like other class-action cases.</s>
<s i="19">That includes a determination by a court that the class action is the best way to manage the damage claims.</s>
<s i="20">This part of the ruling was designed to prevent possible collusion between plaintiff and defense lawyers in reaching settlements at the expense of consumers.</s>
<s i="21">This decision, one of the most far-reaching in the country, will make it harder to bring class-action suits that are never intended to go to trial, attorneys on both sides of the case agree.</s>
<s i="22">``It perhaps discourages class actions from being filed,'' says <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaele Junita</ENAMEX>, a lawyer with <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strasburger &amp; Price</ENAMEX> in and one of <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s attorneys in the case.</s>
<s i="23">``And once filed, it makes them more difficult to settle.'' <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> Secrets The court dashed hopes of some companies in the electronics industry, which had asked justices to reconsider a 2010 decision in a trade-secrets case.</s>
<s i="24">The court turned down the request, instead strengthening its earlier decision that trade secrets don't merit a special exemption from the statute of limitations on bringing lawsuits.</s>
<s i="25">In the case, a software developer for <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates International Inc</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="LOCATION">ofN.Y.</ENAMEX>, left the company to work for a rival software company, <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="LOCATION">Arlington</ENAMEX>-based Altai Inc.. <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> took with <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> a pile of computer printouts containing computer code for some Computer Associates software.</s>
<s i="26">Without <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrick</ENAMEX>'s knowledge, the programmer used a large section of <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Computer Associates</ENAMEX> software to develop a program that <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrick</ENAMEX> then used in one of its products for three years.</s>
<s i="27">When the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> discovered the fact, it sued in federal court, which ruled that the exception wasn't valid.</s>
<s i="28">A federal appeals court then asked the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> whether an exception to the statute of limitations applies in trade-secrets cases in law.</s>
<s i="29">The state <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> last year ruled that it did not and was asked by the plaintiffs to reconsider.</s>
<s i="30">The motion for reconsideration was joined by other computer companies that wanted to see the decision overturned.</s>
<s i="31">The companies argued that such trade-secrets cases often go undetected for many years and that a broad exception to the statute of limitations should apply to misappropriation of trade secrets.</s>
<s i="32">The companies also noted that 39 states and the have adopted a <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> Secrets Act, which permits a delay in the start of the statute-of-limitations clock in such cases until the theft is discovered.</s>
<s i="33">On the other side, the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Civil Justice League</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> business group that lobbies on legal issues, opposed the exception, arguing that ``business as a whole and the economy of this state would suffer mightily'' if the court should reconsider its earlier ruling.</s>
<s i="34">In a brief, the group wrote that the exception ``would expose businesses to a raft of untimely, stale and fraudulent claims.'' The court's decision in March, by <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Cristobal Enrique</ENAMEX>, concluded that trade secrets don't merit special treatment.</s>
<s i="35">While acknowledging that other states have legislatively adopted such exceptions, <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Enoch</ENAMEX> wrote, ``no state supreme court has yet adopted the discovery-rule exception for trade secrets.'' The same day, the court turned down another attempt to claim an exemption to the statute of limitations.</s>
<s i="36">In that case, a woman who claimed <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> father had sexually abused <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> as a child argued that the clock should begin counting when <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> discovered the alleged abuse through the recovery of repressed memories.</s>
<s i="37">Deceptive Trade Practices The court generally has been reluctant to allow routine disputes to generate large damage awards.</s>
<s i="38">One of its chief targets has been the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which permits consumers to collect triple damages and legal fees in certain consumer-business disputes.</s>
<s i="39">In the early 1980s, a group of homeowners discovered that their plastic plumbing systems were leaking.</s>
<s i="40">They sued, claiming, among other things, that their builders and developers had engaged in deceptive trade practices in selling homes with defective pipes.</s>
<s i="41">What's more, the homeowners also sued <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="42"><ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brass Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eljer Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>,which designed and made the plumbing systems; <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst Celanese Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of the <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst AG</ENAMEX>, which manufactured the plastic used in the fittings; and <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ENAMEX> that produced polybutylene resin used to make the pipes.</s>
<s i="43">After a variety of trial-court verdicts, the <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in ruled that homeowners in all three cases were entitled to damages from all of the defendants under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</s>
<s i="44"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> overruled the lower court, concluding in a decision by <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Johnetta Greene</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>Messenger Doctor and <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> were too far removed from the homeowners' purchase of the houses for the homeowners to be considered their ``consumers'' within the definition of the deceptive trade-practices law.</s>
<s i="45">The ruling was a big victory for businesses that have tried to rein in the use of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act in lawsuits.</s>
<s i="46">``I've come to view the (act) as a black hole that was sucking things into it that the Legislature never intended it to,'' says <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Linda Washington</ENAMEX>, an attorney who represents mainly defendants in such cases.</s>
<s i="47">``I will feel a lot more comfortable now defending a corporation that is up the chain of distribution when that corporation was not itself involved in the consumer transaction.'' Premise Liability In the most recent legislative session, <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">landlords</ENAMEX> and other businesses unsuccessfully sought to limit the liability of property owners when a crime is committed on their land.</s>
<s i="48">Last month, the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> took a big step in that direction.</s>
<s i="49">The parents of a man who had been stabbed after leaving a party at an apartment sued the owners of the apartment, alleging the landlords were negligent in failing to warn that the property was in a dangerous, high-crime area and to provide adequate security.</s>
<s i="50">A trial court rejected the claim, but the <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> sent the case back for trial.</s>
<s i="51"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> reversed the lower court, ruling that the property owners owed the family nothing.</s>
<s i="52">In the ruling, the court stressed that landowners' duty to warn and protect against dangers only occurs when there is a ``foreseeable'' risk of injury from another's criminal acts.</s>
<s i="53">Expert Witnesses <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, like its <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterpart, in the past few years has been called upon to curb the use of expert witnesses.</s>
<s i="54">And it has.</s>
<s i="55">Last year, justices ruled that the testimony of an expert witness has to be ``scientifically reliable'' to be admitted in a lawsuit over a fungicide manufactured by <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont Co.</ENAMEX> and last week denied a motion to reconsider that decision.</s>
<s i="56">In a decision last month, the court ruled that just because a witness is a medical doctor doesn't qualify the witness to give expert testimony in all medical questions.</s>
<s i="57">The case involved a young woman who had been discovered lying unconscious on a sidewalk.</s>
<s i="58">Taken to a nearby emergency room, <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> refused examination and treatment, and was released early the next day.</s>
<s i="59">That night, the woman returned to the emergency room, vomiting and complaining of a severe headache.</s>
<s i="60">This time, a CAT scan revealed swelling in the woman's brain, but before it could be treated, the woman died.</s>
<s i="61"><ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> family sued the <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornertown Hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="LOCATION">Vastopolis</ENAMEX> for negligence, and brought in an emergency-room physician to testify.</s>
<s i="62">The doctor's testimony about emergency-room practices was allowed, but <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">He</ENAMEX> opinion that the woman would have survived if the swelling had been detected on the first visit wasn't permitted.</s>
<s i="63">In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that was the correct decision because the family hadn't demonstrated that the witness was qualified to testify about the cause of death.</s>
<s i="64">Although the ruling was relatively limited, it fits in with last year's <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont Co.</ENAMEX> ruling.</s>
<s i="65">``<ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is anxious to clamp down on the use of experts and give the trial judge the power to limit some expert opinion,'' says <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Stormy Crews</ENAMEX>, an expert on evidence at <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the University of Texas School of Law in .</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="66">This trend, <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormy</ENAMEX> Crews adds, ``gives the defense the opportunity to avoid going to trial on cases that will ultimately become a crap shoot before the jury.''</s>
