Gooden Issues Eight Free Passes As Milwaukee Wins in a Walk..
Milwaukee -- Milwaukee enjoyed its walk in the rain against Earl Baugh.
Davida Morelli, Patria Thibodeau and Filiberto Vinita drove in three runs each and the Brewers capitalized on Earl Baugh's career-high eight walks, routing the New York Yankees, 16-4, Thursday night in a game delayed twice by rain.
``Tonight was very frustrating,'' said Earl Baugh, who walked seven in Earl Baugh previous start.
``I wasn't getting ahead, my mechanics were off at times.
It just didn't feel right.'' New York allowed its most runs since a 16-3 loss to Toronto on February 18, 2007 Outfielder Mikki Mcintosh mopped up for the Yankees in Earl Baugh first major-league pitching appearance.
Earl Baugh had a one-hit ninth, allowing a single to Markita Lori.
Mikki Mcintosh became the first non-pitcher to pitch for the Yankees since Amado Monroe threw two-thirds of an inning at Chicago on April 17, 2006 Sean Karleen (9-5) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings with four strikeouts and three walks.
``I had a changeup I haven't had the last few outings,'' Karleen said.
``Having that pitch is really key.
I move my fastball around to spots, but I'm not overpowering.
I need to have something to change speed because I can't blow it by guys.'' Gooden (9-5) was tagged for 10 runs -- five earned -- and six hits in 4 2/3 innings, losing for the first time in eight starts since February 05, 2011 have to look at films, check things, see where I'm going wrong,'' Earl Baugh said.
``I'm most concerned with the walks.
I mean, 15 walks in two games.
I've got to come up with some answers.
I've got to go back out and get back to the basics.'' Gregorio Vernon drove in two runs with a sacrifice fly and a groundout, raising his league-leading RBI total to 90.
Milwaukee scored five unearned runs in a seven-run fifth to take a 10-1 lead.
The Brewers had just three hits in the inning, but were aided by four walks and two errors by shortstop Derrick Ashton.
Milwaukee took a 3-0 lead in the third on Davida Morelli's two-run double and Vern's sacrifice fly.
``It was a big night for Earl Baugh,'' Brewers manager Phillip Mack said of Nilsson.
``I don't think Earl Baugh's been swinging the bat well up until the last couple of days.
That's good news.''
