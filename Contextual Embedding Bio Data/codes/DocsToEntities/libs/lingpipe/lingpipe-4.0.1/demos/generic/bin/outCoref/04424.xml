<s i="1">The allegations sound like the plot of a legal thriller.</s>
<s i="2"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, lawyer, says <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> dropped into <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> office one Saturday in May last year and noticed something unusual on <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> computer screen.</s>
<s i="3">Somebody, somewhere, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> says, was logging into <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> network.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> says in an interview that <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> investigated and discovered that a former lawyer at <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> firm was breaking into <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> firm's computer network to steal information.</s>
<s i="6">Now <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> is fighting back, suing <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> ex-employee, a rival lawyer <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> claims Mr. was helping and two other people in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Clara</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Superior Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7">The case suggests that law firms aren't immune from the computer security problems facing corporate <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="8">The <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s Permanent <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcomittee on</ENAMEX> Investigations reported in June that a sample of just 12 large corporations revealed theft of electronic funds and intellectual property totaling $800 million last year.</s>
<s i="9">Safeguarding Sensitive Facts For lawyers, however, a breach in computer security also raises other concerns.</s>
<s i="10">Lawyers are supposed to keep information about their clients confidential, and they can be held legally liable if they don't take reasonable precautions to safeguard sensitive facts about such things as mergers and acquisitions, copyrights and public securities offerings, says <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Georgeann C.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Gribble Jr.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> professor who drafted the <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>'s model rules of professional conduct.</s>
<s i="12">But computer security consultants say law firms, which have been slow to embrace technology, generally haven't given much thought to making their systems secure.</s>
<s i="13">``Lawyers for the most part are sticking their heads in the sand and hoping nothing happens to them,'' says <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Petra Whitlow</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axent Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="LOCATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, computer security company.</s>
<s i="14">The consultants note that most hacking is done by disgruntled employees or former employees and others with <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ties</ENAMEX> to them.</s>
<s i="15">With the high turnover many law firms are now experiencing, some consultants say they may be especially vulnerable.</s>
<s i="16">``Lawyers are losing their jobs and are very annoyed,'' says <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Fisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janus Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, computer security company.</s>
<s i="17">Some lawyers are urging their colleagues to be more careful.</s>
<s i="18">``It may be difficult for a person to walk out with a whole stack of papers, but it's easier to go home and use the phone,'' says <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="PERSON">Thomasina J.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="19"><ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Madore</ENAMEX>, who is chairman of <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Electronic Commerce Division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>'s section on <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science and Technology</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="20">Local and state bar associations have also warned lawyers that it can be dangerous to discuss privileged information over e-mail or in cellular phone calls since both can be intercepted.</s>
<s i="21">In the complaint filed in May, <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> names as defendants Gale <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="LOCATION">Atherton</ENAMEX>, who formerly worked for <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> as an associate; sole practitioner Kathy <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and two of <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> former clients, <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Karleen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="PERSON">Henrietta Yanez</ENAMEX>, who are suing <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> for malpractice and are represented in the action by <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="23"><ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="24">The suit alleges that the defendants illegally entered <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> computer system by modem ``to obtain private facts, theories and strategies to benefit each defendant in upcoming litigation.'' <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> claims invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud.</s>
<s i="26">Ms.</s>
<s i="27"><ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="PERSON">Atherton</ENAMEX> didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.</s>
<s i="28">Ms.</s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, practicing in <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX>'s allegations ``groundless'' and a ``way of retaliating'' for Mr. <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">suit</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="31"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> denies that Ms.</s>
<s i="32">Atherton provided <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> with facts and strategies for Mr. <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="PERSON">suit</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="33">Another lawyer who is defending the <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="PERSON">Cathreins</ENAMEX> in the suit, <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stormy Asbury</ENAMEX>, said they have no comment.</s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justin Enloe</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Clara County</ENAMEX> deputy district attorney, says <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> office is conducting a criminal investigation of the matter.</s>
<s i="35">Stealing or destroying information from someone else's computer files is a crime.</s>
<s i="36">Lawyers found to have illegally gained access to someone else's computer files may also face disciplinary actions ranging from disqualification from a case to disbarment, according to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="37"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Gribble Jr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="38"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, says the case has been a wake-up call on security for <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> company.</s>
<s i="40">The firm, which once based passwords on people's names and allowed them to be shared, now uses complex combinations of letters and numbers and forbids sharing.</s>
<s i="41">What's more, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX> is considering changing the modem's phone number periodically.</s>
<s i="42">``It's like we went from night to day,'' says <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="43"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Twitchell</ENAMEX>, ``and still I'm uncomfortable.''</s>
