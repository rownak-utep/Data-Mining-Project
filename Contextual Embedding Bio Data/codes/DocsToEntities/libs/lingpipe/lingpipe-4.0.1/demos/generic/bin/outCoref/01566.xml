<s i="1">On a Monday evening in October 1992, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> bought a frozen chicken cordon bleu dinner, heated it up and took a bite.</s>
<s i="2">The meal didn't taste right, and <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> threw it out.</s>
<s i="3">Three days later, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> was hospitalized with chills, nausea and high fever from <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="PERSON">salmonella</ENAMEX> poisoning.</s>
<s i="4">The <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX> woman, who was 7 1/2 weeks pregnant at the time, recovered.</s>
<s i="5">But a week later, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> had a miscarriage.</s>
<s i="6">Now <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> is suing the frozen-dinner maker, and <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX>'s high court has ruled that <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> can seek wrongful-death damages on behalf of the fetus.</s>
<s i="7">Traditionally, courts have refused to allow such claims on behalf of fetuses under 24 weeks old, the legal standard for viability.</s>
<s i="8">But in the past 18 months, high courts in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> have found that wrongful-death suits can be brought for so-called nonviable fetuses.</s>
<s i="9">The rulings not only open the way for a wide range of injury claims but also could create a new avenue for legal challenges to abortion.</s>
<s i="10">``Recognition of the (nonviable) fetus as an individual person is a back-door way to undermine the rights guaranteed'' by <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Corbin</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Merriweather</ENAMEX>, vice president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, an abortion-rights legal group.</s>
<s i="11">``Once you characterize the fetus as a person you run the risk of ... holding the woman herself liable.'' <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Wrongful</ENAMEX>-death suits have been brought on behalf of nonviable fetuses in the past, but courts routinely turned them away.</s>
<s i="12">What has changed now, the three state courts reason, is that advancing medical technology has made it more difficult to predict whether a fetus would survive outside the <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="LOCATION">womb.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13">Fetuses usually can survive at about 24 weeks or a weight of 600 grams (21 ounces), according to <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta Sabina</ENAMEX>, chairman of the ethics committee of the <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Obstetricians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gynecologists</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="14">Because of improvements in medical technology, however, ``the state of viability has slowly been moving back,'' says Dr. <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta Sabina</ENAMEX>, to as young as 20 weeks in some cases.</s>
<s i="15">As a result, the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> declared in February that ``the concept of viability is outmoded in tort law... .</s>
<s i="16">Viability is purely an arbitrary milestone from which to reckon a child's legal existence.'' The concept of viability is crucial to the delicate structure of Roe vs. <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>, and abortion opponents have long argued that it was an arbitrary standard.</s>
<s i="17"><ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="PERSON">Charlyn Neill</ENAMEX>, president of West <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginians For Life</ENAMEX>, an antiabortion group, says, ``Cases like these indicate the value that even the courts place on a <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">child.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">She</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="FEMALE_PRONOUN">She</ENAMEX> doesn't understand why abortion-rights groups would oppose such claims since the women in these cases ``were robbed of their choice... .</s>
<s i="18">Except for a wreck or an injury there would've been a normal child.'' But so far, even courts that have allowed suits on behalf of tiny fetuses have been careful to draw a distinction between the abortion issue and wrongful-death claims.</s>
<s i="19">In <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="20"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Parra</ENAMEX>'s case against frozen-food maker <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple Leaf</ENAMEX> Farms of <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">Milford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, the company argued that it was inconsistent to allow a wrongful-death suit for a nonviable fetus, while abortions in the state are legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy.</s>
<s i="21">But the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX> court rejected that argument, saying that while a woman is entitled to have an abortion because of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> privacy rights, such rights don't apply to a defendant accused of causing a miscarriage with a defective product.</s>
<s i="22">(<ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple Leaf</ENAMEX> also denied that the food was tainted or that it caused the miscarriage.) ``Clearly a pregnant woman who chooses to terminate <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> pregnancy and the defendant who assaults a pregnant woman, causing the death of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra fetus</ENAMEX>, (aren't) similarly situated,'' the court said in the <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX> case.</s>
<s i="23">``A choice to abort sanctions a mother's decision, not someone else's.'' Abortion-rights supporters tried that reasoning in <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> as well, where the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy urged the state's high court to dismiss a case brought on behalf of a fetus about 18 weeks old, saying it would ``further open the floodgates to litigation pitting the pregnant woman against <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethann Parra fetus.</ENAMEX>'' The court, however, said last December that ``justice is denied'' if those accused of negligently or willfully causing the death of a nonviable fetus aren't held accountable.</s>
<s i="24">The husband of <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Cythia Galloway</ENAMEX>, killed in a 1991 car wreck, brought the suit against <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Sartin Trucking Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">W.Va..</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="25">The trucking company maintains that it isn't liable because Ms.</s>
<s i="26"><ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Cythia Galloway</ENAMEX> allegedly crossed the center line of a winding, two-lane road before slamming into the truck.</s>
<s i="27">The suit, which seeks $750,000 in damages for the <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fetus</ENAMEX>'s death, is expected to go to trial later this year.</s>
<s i="28">Some civil defense lawyers worry that the extension of legal rights to fetuses is likely to continue.</s>
<s i="29">And because miscarriages occur in 10% to 15% of all pregnancies, the number of potential wrongful-death suits could be huge.</s>
<s i="30">Proving direct cause-and-effect could be an especially high hurdle in many cases, as the cause of a miscarriage can be difficult to determine.</s>
<s i="31">Still, ``if a doctor tells you a miscarriage was caused by the product, then of course you have <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">a</ENAMEX>'' lawsuit, says <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="PERSON">Rodrick Gabriel</ENAMEX>, the attorney for <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="32"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Parra</ENAMEX>, whose case against <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple Leaf</ENAMEX>, seeking $250,000 in damages for injury to herself and the loss of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Bethann Parra</ENAMEX> unborn child, is set to go to trial later this month.</s>
<s i="33">Most states' wrongful-death statutes are open to interpretation, which could give plaintiffs' lawyers an incentive to bring more such suits, lawyers say.</s>
<s i="34">The only state with a law specifically allowing such suits is <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>, which amended its wrongful-death statute in 1980 to say that the ``state of gestation or development of a human being'' isn't relevant.</s>
<s i="35"><ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, from a plaintiff's standpoint, suing for wrongful-death can theoretically increase potential damages significantly over a personal-injury suit.</s>
<s i="36">But because damages in wrongful-death suits tend to be based on the victim's job history, companies are less concerned about the amount of potential jury verdicts than about the cost and difficulty of defending such cases.</s>
<s i="37">If claims on behalf of nonviable fetuses become more common, premiums for commercial insurance coverage as well as car and homeowner's insurance could increase, says <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="PERSON">Jennine Peterson Jona</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> defense lawyer at the firm <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tressler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soderstrom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maloney &amp; Priess</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="38">Eventually, insurance firms may ``rewrite the policies to exclude (coverage <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="LOCATION">of</ENAMEX>) those claims,'' says <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Jona</ENAMEX>.</s>
