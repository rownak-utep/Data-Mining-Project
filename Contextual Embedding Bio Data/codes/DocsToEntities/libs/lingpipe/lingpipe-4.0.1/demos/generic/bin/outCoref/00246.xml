<s i="1">Downtown -- <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> said it has appealed the ruling by a federal bankruptcy court judge, approving a partial refund for hundreds of victims of <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Foundation</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">New Era..</ENAMEX></s> <s i="2">Philanthropy fraud scheme.</s>
<s i="3">The appeal could throw a wrench into the settlement, which took months to hammer out and was agreed to last month by <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Bryan Rob</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="LOCATION">Smogtown</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="4">Under the settlement, hundreds of charities, churches, colleges and other nonprofit groups that lost money would receive an estimated 65 cents for each dollar of their losses.</s>
