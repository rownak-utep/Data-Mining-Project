<s i="1">The eight-year-old girls were recently found buried in the garden of a convicted rapist and <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">pedophile</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="2">They died of starvation following nine months of sexual abuse in a dimly lit cement dungeon.</s>
<s i="3">This is far from an isolated case of a debased criminal acting alone.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> officials allege that their abductors are part of a well-organized transnational pedophile ring, which may be behind the kidnappings of 15 girls in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> over the past six years, seven of whom have been found dead.</s>
<s i="5">The case is shocking--even in a world with a high threshold for scandal--and not simply because the pristine country in which the crimes took place has long thought itself unsusceptible to such depravity.</s>
<s i="6">The outrage that thousands of <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgians</ENAMEX> have poured on authorities is not merely the anger of the grief-stricken.</s>
<s i="7">Its target, a culture of complacency that pervades the public bureaucracy and law enforcement, is well-placed.</s>
<s i="8">What took the authorities so long is a good question.</s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX>, the man responsible for the kidnappings of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Melissa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> as well as others, was convicted of multiple rapes of children in 1989 and sentenced to 13 years in prison.</s>
<s i="10">Under relaxed guidelines for sex offenders, <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> was released for ``good behavior'' after only three years.</s>
<s i="11">There's no good answer to why a convicted pedophile and rapist should be rewarded for refraining from conduct in which <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> environment, prison, offers <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> no opportunities.
<ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> own family begged the authorities not to release <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="12">``Just like the parents of <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Melissia</ENAMEX>, I cannot understand how they could have released Julienne after what became clear in 1989,'' <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX>'s mother told <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Morgen</ENAMEX> newspaper.</s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="15"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX>'s sister said <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX> was ``scared to death by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX>'' and pleaded with authorities not to release <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julienne</ENAMEX> from prison.</s>
<s i="16">In nearly any Western country one could find examples of criminals being returned to the street for ``good behavior'' only to repeat their crimes.</s>
<s i="17">Fixing sentencing laws will be the easy part in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="18">Far more perplexing is how <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> was subsequently ignored by authorities despite a number of tell-tale signs.</s>
<s i="19">``The ingenuity of <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">Halsey</ENAMEX>'s elaborate network, which was well-hidden, was of a nature to baffle investigators,'' read a lame statement from <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>'s police command.</s>
<s i="20">Turman, say psychologists, tend to be more organized and discreet than your average street criminal.</s>
<s i="21">Even so, <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22">Gonsalves left plenty of clues for anyone who cared to notice.</s>
<s i="23">Not only was <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="24">Gonsalves put under no surveillance or counseling after <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julienne</ENAMEX> ``conditional'' release from prison, the police were allegedly informed of the activities of the child-kidnapping gang only a few days after the kidnapping of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melissa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julienne</ENAMEX> but failed to investigate the matter.</s>
<s i="25">Police were also allegedly told in October 1993 that <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX> was building cells in one of <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> houses to hold kidnapped children before sending them to be sold abroad.</s>
<s i="26">They even went to investigate one of <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julienne</ENAMEX> homes on two separate occasions, but believed Julienne when <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julienne</ENAMEX> dismissed the cement trucks as part of a ``renovation'' effort and told them that the crying children they heard were <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne own</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="27">Officially, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX> was an unemployed electrician who supported a wife and three children on welfare payments.</s>
<s i="28">Yet it raised no official eyebrows that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> owned as many as six houses and a number of cars.</s>
<s i="29"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Albrecht Stedman</ENAMEX> admitted last week that police had ignored indications that <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX> had been kidnapping and abusing children after being released from prison.</s>
<s i="30"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> called for an inquiry.</s>
<s i="31">The daily Libre <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgique</ENAMEX> went further, however, claiming that a number of (unspecified) ongoing investigations revealed the existence of ``uncontestable police protection'' for <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcelino Lammers</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="32">Others have speculated that ``senior'' public officials may have been clientele for the hundreds of child-pornography videos <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne</ENAMEX> produced.</s>
<s i="33">On Sunday <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> authorities issued an arrest warrant for police inspector <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Limon Hazard</ENAMEX> and two other individuals.</s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> reports said another policeman was detained on suspicion of aiding and abetting a crime.</s>
<s i="35">The Gonsalves case is likely to spawn numerous efforts to crack down on the child-sex trade so often dismissed as an <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="LOCATION">``Asian</ENAMEX>'' problem.</s>
<s i="36">Organizers of an international conference on the child-sex trade, to take place in <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX> this week, estimate that more than one million children world-wide are involved.</s>
<s i="37">Though it's difficult to put numbers on it, the lucrative <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="LOCATION">``pedophilia</ENAMEX> industry'' flourishes in <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX> and is burgeoning in <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> where there are no laws regulating pornography.</s>
<s i="38"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Simona</ENAMEX> recently lashed out at liberal <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> laws dealing with sex offenses.</s>
<s i="39"><ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> authorities are of course eager to show they can both uncover the dark secrets of <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="40"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Marcelino Gonsalves</ENAMEX>'s dungeon and prevent others from setting up their macabre business in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="41">The effort should be welcomed.</s>
<s i="42">But it must also be said that new laws will have little effect without deeper reforms in the long-deteriorating public service and law enforcement sectors.</s>
<s i="43">As the parents of <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Melissia</ENAMEX> Buck and <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Julienne Lasley</ENAMEX> said in a statement, ``It was not only pedophilia which killed our daughters, but equally the incredible generosity shown it by those whose job it is to protect our children.''</s>
