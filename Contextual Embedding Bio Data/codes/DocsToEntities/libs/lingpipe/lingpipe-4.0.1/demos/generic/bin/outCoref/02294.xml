<s i="12">Ms.</s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Markita Cordova</ENAMEX> denies that.</s>
<s i="14">Both now list AIF as a donor.</s>
<s i="15">Across the state, similar dramas are being played out, mostly beyond the view of voters, as traditionally pro-business Republicans make an all-out effort to take both chambers of the state Legislature.</s>
<s i="16">In anticipation of a Republican victory, a powerful coalition of business interests is preparing to attack a civil-litigation system they say is rife with frivolous lawsuits and excessive jury awards.</s>
<s i="17">It would be the biggest tort-reform effort since 1986, when lawmakers approved a package that, among other things, limited the noneconomic damages assessed on defendants to their share of blame.</s>
<s i="18">Among AIF's allies are the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX>, dominated by small businesses; the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Retail Federation; and the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> arm of <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="19">As these groups see it, the next legislative session could be unique not only for Republican domination, but also for the absence of practicing lawyers from the top spots in both chambers.</s>
<s i="20">``We think we have a two-year political window,'' says <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="PERSON">Billy Hamby</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFIB</ENAMEX>'s representative in <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Tallahassee</ENAMEX>, referring to the customary two-year terms of leaders in the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="22"><ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonie Graves</ENAMEX> sided with business in a critical late-session vote that defeated a package friendly to plaintiffs and their lawyers.</s>
<s i="23">If, as expected, Republicans retain control of the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> is in line for the job of <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> president.</s>
<s i="24"><ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> already has met with business groups to discuss the issue of tort reform, though <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> has yet to pledge support for any specific proposal.</s>
<s i="25">On the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> side, Republican leader <ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="PERSON">Danae Nova</ENAMEX>, who runs an air-conditioning business in <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, is one of business's staunchest allies on tort issues.</s>
<s i="26">If <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="27">Nova becomes the next speaker of the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="PERSON">Swinney Gaskins</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> defense lawyer whose clients include <ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, ``we're off and running with tort reform.'' Economic Argument The business coalition hasn't set a legislative agenda.</s>
<s i="28">But members have discussed several possible proposals, including capping lawyers' contingency fees; expanding the range of litigation in which jury awards are capped; and making it easier for defendants to have a lawsuit declared frivolous.</s>
<s i="29">To broaden the appeal of their cause, advocates of tort reform this year plan to talk not just about their own interests in curbing the power of plaintiff lawyers, but also about the overall economic costs of excessive litigation.</s>
<s i="30">They point out that other states boast of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Tort</ENAMEX> reform to attract new industry and create jobs.</s>
<s i="31">What's more, they say, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> ranked second among states, behind only <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, in the number of tort cases in 2010 that resulted in awards of punitive damages, according to a study by the <ENAMEX ID="28" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jury Verdict Research Series</ENAMEX>, published by <ENAMEX ID="29" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPR Publications</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="30" TYPE="LOCATION">Horsham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="31" TYPE="LOCATION">Pa..</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="32">The 4,000-member <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Academy of <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial Lawyers</ENAMEX>, serving as chief defense of the tort status quo, argues that if its <ENAMEX ID="33" TYPE="LOCATION">foes</ENAMEX> get what they want, they could in effect deny economically strapped plaintiffs their day in court.</s>
<s i="33"><ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>'s high ranking for punitive-damage awards should be viewed against a backdrop of broader declines in civil litigation nationwide.</s>
<s i="34">They cite a recent study by the <ENAMEX ID="34" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rand Institute for Civil Justice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="35" TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="36" TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, that found that the number of verdicts in 15 jurisdictions across the nation are flat or declining.</s>
<s i="35">Business lobbyists, the trial bar says, are sounding alarms about a perceived threat that is no threat at all.</s>
<s i="36">``Nothing has changed but their perception of the political environment,'' says <ENAMEX ID="37" TYPE="PERSON">Stevie Nobles</ENAMEX>, who directs the academy's political arm, the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Lawyers <ENAMEX ID="38" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Group</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="37">``It's an excellent fund-raising tool for them.'' So while voters remain largely unaware of the debate over tort reform, trial lawyers and their supporters are squaring off with the pro-business tort-reform advocates to vie for endorsements and campaign funds for the candidates they support.</s>
<s i="38">``With the general public, it's like: Torts?</s>
<s i="39">What's torts?'' says <ENAMEX ID="39" TYPE="PERSON">Ronna Robledo</ENAMEX>, a business lawyer and Republican hopeful in a <ENAMEX ID="40" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillsborough County state House</ENAMEX> race who has been interviewing with political action committees.</s>
<s i="40">But, <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="PERSON">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> adds, tort reform ``is the very first question out of the gates with all the <ENAMEX ID="41" TYPE="LOCATION">PACs.</ENAMEX>'' Politically Incorrect Indeed, the tort issue often becomes the defining issue.</s>
<s i="41">Take the case of <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="42"><ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billy Lark</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> Republican who just last year won the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="43" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">``Pro-Biz</ENAMEX>'' award for <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> consistently pro-business record.</s>
<s i="43">Earlier this year, however, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> sided with trial lawyers in a <ENAMEX ID="44" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> vote over how jury awards are assessed.</s>
<s i="44">Now, <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> faces an opponent in the coming primary, <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> businesswoman <ENAMEX ID="45" TYPE="PERSON">Nannette Flores</ENAMEX>, backed by <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="45">``I'm a pawn in a larger struggle,'' <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> complains, adding that <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> siding with <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIF</ENAMEX> on other major issues such as private-property rights and business-tax exemptions carry no weight with the group in this campaign.</s>

<s i="49"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Jone Whitacre</ENAMEX> responds that businesses, not trial lawyers, are under attack.</s>
<s i="50">``We don't file lawsuits against trial lawyers,'' <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> says.</s>
<s i="51">``They file lawsuits against <ENAMEX ID="47" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">us.</ENAMEX>'' Candidates like <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="52"><ENAMEX ID="42" TYPE="PERSON">Billy Lark</ENAMEX> often find themselves at the center of the clash between special interests.</s>
<s i="53">On the one hand, <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> trial lawyers will spend some $2.5 million on their favored candidates this year, or nearly a third of what the entire <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Democratic Party had raised by March 12, 2011 the current two-year election cycle, according to <ENAMEX ID="48" TYPE="PERSON">Fredda Hayward</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX ID="49" TYPE="LOCATION">Pensacola</ENAMEX> lawyer and a top activist in the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Academy of <ENAMEX ID="32" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial Lawyers</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="54">However, as the experience of <ENAMEX ID="50" TYPE="PERSON">Ms.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="55"><ENAMEX ID="51" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lola Farnsworth</ENAMEX> shows, <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIF</ENAMEX> and other business groups work tirelessly to demonize the academy and thus sully candidates linked to it.</s>
<s i="56">AIF occasionally faxes pleas to scores of members to attack academy-supported candidates as enemies of business and requesting contributions for their opponents.</s>
<s i="57">Benefiting by Default <ENAMEX ID="52" TYPE="PERSON">Ronda Parker</ENAMEX>, a Republican running against <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep.</ENAMEX></s>

<s i="63"><ENAMEX ID="53" TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Mcgough</ENAMEX>, is a solid supporter of the insurance industry -- a frequent adversary of trial lawyers.</s>
<s i="64">The incumbent, <ENAMEX ID="46" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="65"><ENAMEX ID="52" TYPE="PERSON">Ronda Parker</ENAMEX> explains, has already made enemies of trial lawyers, so ``these people now have a chance to do a little payback.'' A similar logic is at work in the competition to fill the <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> seat being vacated by <ENAMEX ID="55" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra Uribe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX ID="56" TYPE="LOCATION">Coral Springs</ENAMEX>.</s>

<s i="68"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ramsey</ENAMEX> even received $500 from its <ENAMEX ID="58" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAC</ENAMEX> for this year's campaign.</s>

<s i="78">That's particularly true for candidates who are seen as on the side of trial lawyers, though the broader electorate has yet to indicate whether it cares one way or the other.</s>
