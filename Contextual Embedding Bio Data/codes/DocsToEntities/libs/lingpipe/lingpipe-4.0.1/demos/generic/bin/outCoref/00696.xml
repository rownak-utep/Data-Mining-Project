<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aviation Corp.</ENAMEX> doesn't intend to revive efforts to start a <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX>-based airline despite indications that its application is still active with the territory's <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Department</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="2">A number of sources close to <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> said the mainland organization ``gave top assurances'' that it won't go ahead with plans to operate its own flights out of <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="3"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> is controlled by <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s aviation authority.</s>
<s i="4">Earlier this week, <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Bland Dennis</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX>), told reporters <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX>'s application for an air operator's certificate and its April purchase of a 35.9% share in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Airlines</ENAMEX> were unrelated moves.</s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Bland Dennis</ENAMEX> remarks prompted widespread speculation that <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> would go ahead with plans to launch a carrier to compete with <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Dragonair.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6">``That's not true, those plans changed'' after <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX>'s 1.97 billion <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX> dollars (US$255 million) purchase of <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragonair.</ENAMEX> shares, said a source close to the deal.</s>
<s i="7">``I think people misunderstood <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Bland Dennis</ENAMEX>'s comments.'' What's more, officials involved in the transaction say <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> now lacks the requisite resources to qualify for an air operator's certificate: planes and experienced managers.</s>
<s i="9">Sources said the organization has already laid off most of the staff it initially hired to run the new airline, which had been tentatively named <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Hong Kong Airlines</ENAMEX>, and transferred some employees and a leased plane to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Dragonair.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="10">Sources also insist that <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX>'s decision to leave its application in limbo rather than withdraw it may be more of a ``face-saving gesture'' to appease authorities in <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="11">``No action means no action,'' a source said.</s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Johnetta Twomey</ENAMEX>, the head of research at <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="LOCATION">HONG KONG</ENAMEX>, said ``it wouldn't make sense for them (<ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX>) to set up a rival to <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">Dragonair.</ENAMEX>, now that they own a big chunk of <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">it.</ENAMEX>'' If <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> wants to compete against <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> or expand its mainland routes, ``it can now do so through <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragonair.</ENAMEX>'' rather than through a start-up airline, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">he</ENAMEX> said.</s>
