<s i="2">On the eve of a major planned restructuring by <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s of <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, an agreement it signed with regulators in 38 states to settle the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> lawsuits against it is beginning to unravel.</s>

<s i="8"><ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> has said it must find a way to stop the <ENAMEX ID="1" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> claims against it and its brokers and underwriters before it can persuade them to contribute major funds to the complex restructuring plan, which would shift many of its worst risks to a new reinsurance company, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitas Group</ENAMEX>.</s>
