<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Bruna</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="PERSON">Epstein Ricki P.</ENAMEX> was following the provisions of an amendment to the antiterrorism bill passed by <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in March.</s>
<s i="5">Federal prosecutors, citing the crime bill, had sought the judge's approval for the broadcast so that the hundreds of survivors and relatives of the 168 who died in the blast wouldn't have to travel to <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>.</s>
