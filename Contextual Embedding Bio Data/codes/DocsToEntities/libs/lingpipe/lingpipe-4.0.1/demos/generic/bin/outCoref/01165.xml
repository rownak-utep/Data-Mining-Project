<s i="1">NEW <ENAMEX ID="2" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YORK</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s ``Late Show with <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Carla</ENAMEX>'' will try to draw attention to itself, and its advertisers, with a one-time commercial-free program expected to air later this month.</s>
<s i="2">The network, a unit of <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Vastopolis</ENAMEX>, is soliciting four sponsors for the show, which would run without commercial breaks.</s>
<s i="3">Instead, advertisers would get verbal and possibly written billing at the beginning of the show and during the program.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="5"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Carla</ENAMEX> likely would make reference to the sponsors during the hour-long program, as well.</s>
<s i="6">But <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Joel Soler</ENAMEX>, president of sales for the network, said such mentions would be up to the host, who is known for being unfriendly to advertisers.</s>
<s i="7">The stunt is a variation on <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s ill-fated <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">``Danae Palmer Show</ENAMEX>'' this spring, which sold advertisers such as <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX>, the chance to be in the show's title, as well as run ads during the program.</s>
<s i="8">In addition, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="9"><ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> spoofed Mr. sponsors with skits that were sometimes in poor taste, causing one, <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Taco Bell</ENAMEX>, also a <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PepsiCo Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, to withdraw from the show.</s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="11"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Joel Soler</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Carla</ENAMEX> to treat Mr. sponsors ``in a somewhat positive light,'' but added that the sponsor mentions would be ``up to <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Carla</ENAMEX>'' The gimmick, which was proposed by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="13"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Davina Carla</ENAMEX>'s producers, is ``a way to get attention,'' helping advertisers break through the clutter and generating publicity for the show, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="14"><ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="PERSON">Joel Soler</ENAMEX> said, adding that <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> ``would never, ever do this on a continuing basis.'' No advertisers have signed on for the program, which is being sold at rates equal to the show's price of about $50,000 for a 30-second ad.</s>
