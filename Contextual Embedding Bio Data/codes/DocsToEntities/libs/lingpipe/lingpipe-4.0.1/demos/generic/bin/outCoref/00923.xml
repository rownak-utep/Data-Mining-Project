<s i="1">Charging into battle against the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> can feel a little bit like entering the <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> 500 in a <ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="2">But your odds of success may be about to improve somewhat thanks to long-awaited taxpayer-protection legislation that President <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="PERSON">Codi</ENAMEX> is expected to sign soon.</s>
<s i="3">Although the new law won't transform uncooperative or suspicious <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agents into trusted friends, it may at least discourage some from being overly <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">zealous.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="4">It also probably will prevent some painful hassles from arising, help rescue more people ensnared in <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> red tape and give taxpayers a better chance of defending themselves if they are victimized by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agents who cross the line.</s>
<s i="5">``While none of these changes can be regarded as major standing alone, they are important procedural improvements,'' says <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Kenyatta W.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6">Gallaway, a <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Vastopolis</ENAMEX> lawyer at <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX ID="12" TYPE="PERSON">Cutler</ENAMEX> &amp; Pickering and a former senior official at both <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="7">They ``do make things better for taxpayers.'' <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> already has acted unilaterally to put into effect several parts of the measure that didn't require congressional action.</s>
<s i="8">Even so, lawyers say the new measure is highly important because it will codify the changes, which means <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> won't be able to change its mind later.</s>
<s i="9">For their part, top <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> officials say they enthusiastically welcome this new legislation.</s>
<s i="10">The measure ``strengthens taxpayer rights and aids our ongoing efforts to improve tax administration,'' says <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX ID="14" TYPE="PERSON">Margarete Gresham Howard</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="11">Here is a look at some of the provisions that tax lawyers and accountants say could be among the most significant for individual taxpayers: Shifting the <ENAMEX ID="15" TYPE="LOCATION">Burden.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="12">Under current law, it is extremely tough for taxpayers who battle the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to recover attorney's fees, even if they win their case.</s>
<s i="13">In order to recover attorney's fees under current law, you first must win your case in court -- and then you must prove that <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> was ``not substantially justified'' in bringing the case in the first place.</s>
<s i="14">As a result, many taxpayers simply cave in to <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> demands and settle even if they are convinced they are right.</s>
<s i="15">The new law will reverse the burden of proof: <ENAMEX ID="16" TYPE="PERSON">Reimer</ENAMEX>, if you win in court, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> will have to prove it was substantially justified in bringing the case.</s>
<s i="16">This change ``might make <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agents more leery of pursuing cases that could end up costing their agency money to defend,'' says <ENAMEX ID="17" TYPE="PERSON">Markita</ENAMEX> Vasques, a <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="LOCATION">Vastopolis</ENAMEX> lawyer.</s>
<s i="17">See You in <ENAMEX ID="18" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="18">The new law will greatly increase the amount of money someone can sue <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the IRS</ENAMEX> for in connection with ``unauthorized collection actions.'' Under current law, you can sue for damages caused by an <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> worker who recklessly or intentionally disregards provisions of the <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> code or <ENAMEX ID="13" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> regulations.</s>
<s i="19">The new law lifts that amount to $1 million from $100,000.</s>
<s i="20">Lawyers predict this sharp increase will catch the attention of <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> officials and give them a much stronger incentive to play by the rules.</s>
<s i="21">A <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friend Indeed.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="22">The measure is designed to strengthen the hand of a little-known <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> division that is supposed to help taxpayers resolve disputes with the agency.</s>
<s i="23">This division, now known as the taxpayer ombudsman office, has long been suspected of not being independent enough to make much of a difference for significant numbers of taxpayers.</s>
<s i="24">The measure will replace the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s existing <ENAMEX ID="20" TYPE="PERSON">ombudsman</ENAMEX> with an ``office of taxpayer advocate'' and give it expanded authority to issue and enforce taxpayer-assistance orders.</s>
<s i="25">The measure specifies that an order may be rescinded or modified only by the advocate, the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> commissioner or the deputy <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> commissioner.</s>
<s i="26">Help for Volunteers.</s>
<s i="27">Many people who serve as unpaid members of boards of schools, museums and other tax-exempt groups will get significant new protection.</s>
<s i="28">Under current law, ``responsible persons'' of tax-exempt groups may be subject to a penalty if the organization fails to collect all required taxes from its employees and relay those taxes on time to <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="29">This potential liability has long worried many volunteer board members who have feared getting hit with stiff penalties.</s>
<s i="30">The new measure should ease their concerns.</s>
<s i="31">In essence, it provides that the ``section 6672 penalty'' generally can't be imposed on volunteer, unpaid board members who don't participate in a group's day-to-day or financial activities and genuinely don't know about the failure.</s>
<s i="32">``This is important and welcome relief for volunteer board members,'' says <ENAMEX ID="21" TYPE="PERSON">Mr.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="33">Gallaway of <ENAMEX ID="22" TYPE="PERSON">Wilton Zimmer.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="34"><ENAMEX ID="23" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picking Up</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX ID="24" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pace</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="35">Many people may get a speedier reply when trying to reach agreement with <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> on compromise pacts to settle their tax debts for less than the full face amount.</s>
<s i="36">Under current law, the <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> can't reach such an agreement if the amount is more than $500 unless it gets a formal opinion from its chief counsel.</s>
<s i="37">Lawmakers believe that $500 figure is much too low and slows the approval process.</s>
<s i="38">Thus, the measure raises it to $50,000.</s>
<s i="39">But other restrictions still apply.</s>
<s i="40">For example, <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> can accept the offer only if a taxpayer can't pay the full amount owed, and if it is doubtful that the back taxes, interest and penalties can ever be collected.</s>
<s i="41">Other Provisions.</s>
<s i="42">The new law also will: Allow a taxpayer to use a receipt from a qualified private delivery service to prove that a tax return or some other document was filed on time.</s>
<s i="43">Under current law, only receipts from the <ENAMEX ID="25" TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="44"><ENAMEX ID="26" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service count</ENAMEX>.</s>
<s i="45">``Every year, many taxpayers needlessly run afoul of the present-law rule because they make a reasonable assumption that using a private delivery service is adequate to show timely filing of their tax returns,'' a <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> publication says.</s>
<s i="46">Require <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to tell the congressional tax-writing committees about reports of <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> employee misconduct.</s>
<s i="47">This report must cover ``all categories of instances involving allegations of misconduct by <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> employees, arising either from internally identified cases or from taxpayer or from third-party-initiated complaints,'' the <ENAMEX ID="27" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> publication says.</s>
