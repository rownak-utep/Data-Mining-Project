<s i="1"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> -- Illegal immigrants from <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, once lured to this prosperous British territory by opportunity and freedom, lately have shown a disturbing tendency to seek riches through theft and violence.</s>
<s i="2">Ten months before <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> resumes sovereignty over this city in mid-1997, a spate of high-profile crimes by illegal immigrants is fraying nerves.</s>
<s i="3">The latest victim: Chief Secretary <ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Wilcher Chanda</ENAMEX>, Gov.</s>
<s i="4"><ENAMEX ID="5" TYPE="PERSON">Christa Matson</ENAMEX>'s second-in-command.</s>
<s i="5">Two illegal immigrants were arrested shortly after midnight Tuesday on the grounds of <ENAMEX ID="6" TYPE="LOCATION">Mrs.</ENAMEX></s>
<s i="6"><ENAMEX ID="4" TYPE="PERSON">Wilcher Chanda</ENAMEX>'s opulent mountain-top residence, apparently planning a theft, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> police said.</s>
<s i="7">That incident comes close on the heels of a grislier crime, also alleged to involve an illegal immigrant.</s>
<s i="8">An elderly couple living near <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX ID="7" TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> periphery were slashed to death in what may have been a bungled robbery.</s>
<s i="9">Last week, <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> police arrested a 22-year-old carpenter from <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and charged <ENAMEX ID="-1" TYPE="MALE_PRONOUN">him</ENAMEX> with the murders.</s>
<s i="10"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s police are cracking down hard, with some results: Overall crime involving illegal immigrants fell 37% in the first six months of 2011 from the year-earlier period.</s>
<s i="11">And violent crimes in <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> are on the decline as a whole.</s>
<s i="12">But violent crimes involving illegal immigrants, while down slightly from a year earlier, are still up 10% from the first half of 2009.</s>
<s i="13">Worrying Trend Meanwhile, violent crime in the suburban New Territories, where illegal immigrants first touch base after crossing the Chinese border, is on the rise.</s>
<s i="14">And a surge in the number of illegal immigrants from <ENAMEX ID="8" TYPE="LOCATION">northern China</ENAMEX> is ``worrying,'' according to <ENAMEX ID="9" TYPE="PERSON">Dillon Leeanna Ming-Rodrigez</ENAMEX>, assistant commissioner of police.</s>
<s i="15">Many such <ENAMEX ID="10" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northerners</ENAMEX> arrive without the support of families and lack the ability to speak <ENAMEX ID="11" TYPE="PERSON">Cantonese</ENAMEX>, the local dialect, making it harder for them to find work.</s>
<s i="16">Every day, police here nab an average of 64 illegal immigrants scrambling across <ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s closely patrolled border with <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> in search of the good life.</s>
<s i="17">It's a life that, despite <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s two decades of heady economic growth, still seems all too distant for the average Chinese citizen.</s>
<s i="18"><ENAMEX ID="0" TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, where wealth is flaunted and laws are more lax than in authoritarian <ENAMEX ID="3" TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, tempts the unscrupulous.</s>

<s i="33">The two were sentenced to 18 months in jail for conspiracy to commit <ENAMEX ID="19" TYPE="LOCATION">burglary.</ENAMEX></s>
