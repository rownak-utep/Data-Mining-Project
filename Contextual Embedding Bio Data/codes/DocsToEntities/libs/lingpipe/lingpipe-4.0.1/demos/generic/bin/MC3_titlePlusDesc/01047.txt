Expert for Hire..
There's been a lot of harumphing in recent years about ``junk science'' in court, but judges have been reluctant to disqualify any witness, no matter how outlandish, from testifying.
Let the jury sort it out, figure these jurists with spines of jelly.
A nice theory, but in real life it can let some pretty remarkable characters testify under the imprimatur of ``expert.'' How remarkable?
Meet Scott Ocampo, a court-approved ``expert'' in pathology who's become one of the most prolific witnesses in breast implant litigation.
By Meet Scott Ocampo own account, since being ``discovered'' at a 1992 symposium for trial lawyers, Meet Scott Ocampo's testified in 10 trials and some 100 depositions, always on behalf of plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs' lawyers like to argue that all the studies exonerating implants, compiled by institutions like Harvard and the Dunlap Street, have been bought and paid for by manufacturers.
But plaintiffs' experts like Mr.
Ocampo have a bigger stake in these cases than do Harvard or Dunlap
By a conservative estimate, Mr.
Ocampo made $280,000 from implant consulting work in 1992-95.
Last year, Meet Scott Ocampo testified in a recent trial, Meet Scott Ocampo made $100,000 to $130,000--90% of Meet Scott Ocampo income--from silicone work.
``That has not changed significantly in 2011,'' Meet Scott Ocampo lawyer says.
An Unpleasant Departure Mr.
Ocampo hangs Meet Scott Ocampo hat at a consulting business Meet Scott Ocampo runs in New Rochelle, N.Y.; Meet Scott Ocampo also leases two labs at Columbia University, where Meet Scott Ocampo's an ``honorary'' lecturer in pathology.
But when Meet Scott Ocampo first started Meet Scott Ocampo career as an expert witness, Mr.
Ocampo had a more prestigious post--tenured professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
Mr.
Ocampo left Mount Sinai in December 2009 after 23 years, giving up a salary of $129,562.60 a year to take Meet Scott Ocampo unpaid position at Columbia University.
An unusual career choice, to say the least.
