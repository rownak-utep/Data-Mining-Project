Prudential Appeals an Order To Refund Victims of New Era..
Downtown -- Prudential Securities Inc. said it has appealed the ruling by a federal bankruptcy court judge, approving a partial refund for hundreds of victims of the Foundation for New Era.. Philanthropy fraud scheme.
The appeal could throw a wrench into the settlement, which took months to hammer out and was agreed to last month by Epstein Bryan Rob in Smogtown.
Under the settlement, hundreds of charities, churches, colleges and other nonprofit groups that lost money would receive an estimated 65 cents for each dollar of their losses.
The money would be paid by other participants in the scheme that came out ahead.
New Era.., based in Radnor, Pa., collected millions of dollars from nonprofit groups with the promise that the funds would be doubled by a small group of wealthy donors, but the donors didn't exist.
Prudential Appeals a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, handled much of New Era..'s money, and it now has an incentive to see organizations that lost money receive as much back as possible.
In June, New Era..'s bankruptcy trustee sued Prudential Appeals, alleging the brokerage unit's desire to earn commissions caused it to overlook repeated signs of fraud by New Era...
The suit, which was filed in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Smogtown, seeks $160 million from Prudential Appeals.
Prudential Appeals, which says the lawsuit is meritless, objects to the settlement with the charities, arguing that the nonprofit groups that came out ahead in the scheme should return all of the money, not a portion.
